Call for Ideas: Two times a year, Talented Youngsters / High Potential submit a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) with an idea that generates economic, ecological, and social impact for the region (first deadline by the end of the winter term, e.g. January, second deadline by the end of the summer term, e.g. July). \n2. Idea Pitch: Two times a year, during the Idea Pitch Day, a max of 4 Talented Youngsters / High Potentials are selected (based on the submitted factsheets) to pitch in front of a panel of experienced entrepreneurs from the region / experts of the respective fields (e.g., 5 to 10 entrepreneurs/experts).\nIdea Pitch Day:\no Welcome & Introduction of program, participants, entrepreneurs/experts\no Idea Pitch of a max. of 4 ideas (15 minutes time per pitch)\no Evaluation of pitches and ideas by entrepreneurs/experts in camera (1 hour), selection of the winning idea and selection of mentor candidates. The entrepreneurs/experts decide, which idea they are most interested in and which idea they would be willing to support and which Talented Youngster they would like to mentor over half a year. It may be that they all want to support and accompany the same idea and only one Talented Youngster. This is a strategic decision (although it might be emotionally driven too) and depends on the field of expertise, on the individual chemistry between mentor and mentee, and on the conviction that the mentor can contribute, but will get something in return too.\no Mentor Matching: Those mentors, who decide to support a Talented Youngster and his/her idea, stand up and offer their help, giving a short promotional speech why they would like to help and why they are the right choice of a mentor. The Talented Youngster decides by whom he/she would like to be mentored. If the Talented Youngster finds a mentor, the matching is successful and both will proceed to the awarding ceremony. Each Talented Youngster can only decide for one mentor, although several offers may have been made, unless mentors do not decide to cooperate (entrepreneurs may decide to bundle their competences and support an idea as a team). It may be that all four Talented Youngsters get an offer; it may be that none of the candidates gets an offer. The matching should ideally bring together a young start-upper and a successful entrepreneur, but also for example an enthusiastic young intrapreneur with a leader/manger/CEO or a young professional with an expert of the field.\no Awarding Ceremony: if a matching between Talented Youngster and Experienced Entrepreneur takes place, these two proceed to the awarding ceremony. If possible, the entrepreneur/expert offers also monetary start-up aid to support the idea, but above all, the entrepreneur agrees to act as a role model and mentor for the youngster, sharing feedback, insights and network for a period of six months.\n3. Mentoring: Learning together is better \u2013 The Talented Youngsters document their journey (e.g. in a diary, blog) with the experienced entrepreneur/expert throughout six months. They meet every month at least once (digital or in person). The mentoring process is coordinated and pre-structured by the instructor/facilitator. Documentation (e.g. diary keeping, blog) must be provided for each meeting:\n\nMentoring Process\nMonth Milestones Description Documentation\nMonth 1 1. Familiarization Get to know each other: the entrepreneur introduces the Youngster to his/her spheres of action. The Youngster again explains his/her intentions. Common goals are defined. Photo of the first meeting and outline of common goals in written form.\nMonth 2 2. Polishing idea Idea is presented again and entrepreneur gives critical feedback and suggestions for improvement. Written reflection about feedback by Talented Youngster.\nMonth 3 3. Network Introduction into the network of the entrepreneur, establishing contacts and building up a network. Proof of contacting a min. of 5 relevant stakeholders (e.g. email correspondence, photo, etc.).\nMonth 4 4. Prototyping and Interim Presentation Pilot phase and pre-implementation phase of idea. Documentation of the prototyping phase via Screencast, created jointly by Youngster and entrepreneur.\nMonth 5 5. Mentoring This milestone refers to the lessons learned during the mentoring, in particular inspiration and benefits that the entrepreneur can take away from the mentoring. Of course, also challenges and negative reflections should be shared. Written reflection about mentoring process and mentoring experience. \nMonth 6 6. Idea Realization This is the ideal case but not a must. Try to evaluate if the intended goals have been reached or explain why they could have not been reached and how to reach them in the future. Give an outlook for the future (e.g. is the idea worth to be pursued in future? Development opportunities\u2026). Two final reports, one by the Youngster and one by the entrepreneur.\n\nPreparation for Instructors/Facilitators:\n1. Connect with entrepreneurs / experts from the region and try to convince them for the program. This is not a must, but it will be much easier if you have allies and is much more in scope of the program as it renders the program more effective in terms of developing and fostering the competence learning through experience and making a regional impact.\n2. Try to activate your partners and network in the region and let them sign a memorandum of understanding to participate in the program as mentors for six months. These mentors act as enabler, start-up support, idea polishers, role model, inspirers, experts and evaluators. Do not forget to point out the value added for participating in this program as mentors (example below). At the same time, try to convince them to give start up aids and provide monetary support to those ideas/talents that they are especially interested in. Alternatively, you may choose internal candidates from your own organisation to take part in the program.\nBenefits for entrepreneurs/experts:\no Access to and active shaping of innovative ideas with added value for the region.\no Setting the course for the regional economy and innovativeness.\no Network expansion.\no Exchanging ideas with young motivated people and forming the next generation of entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs in the region/organization.\no Collecting mentoring experience and considering it for human resource development or customer relationship management.\no PR & image cultivation.\n3. Try to identify talented youngsters in your area in terms of high potentials. You may have internal processes/programs, which will guide you in doing so. If not you may start an open call for submissions of ideas where everybody can submit ideas (every employee of an organisation / every student at the university) or only a selected pool of people (only employees from the department/working group XY / students belonging to the faculty of social sciences).\n4. Prepare a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) that must be filled in in order to submit an idea. We recommend a digital process, e.g. online form.\n5.

However, having a brilliant idea is not enough. Often even brilliant and excellent ideas are dismissed because investors and customers cannot see the potential and the value of the idea. It is therefore crucial not only to generate new ideas, but also to eval-uate what potential they have (economically, socially and cultural-ly).\nHere are two examples for exercises: \nExercise 1:\nSplit the class into four or five groups (depends on the size of participants). Let them think of ideas and let them spend five minutes on the idea, brain-storming on the following parameters: \n\uf02d What facts do we know about the idea?\n\uf02d What is positive about the idea?\n\uf02d What is negative?\n\uf02d What kind of feelings do the participants have when they realise the idea?\nAfterward, each group presents their answers and conclusions. \nThe aim of this exercise is to be conscious, that every idea has different points and aspects. \n\nExercise 2:\n\uf02d In a first step, let the participants in groups create a mind map with different aspects of an idea and what aspects should be considered (economic, social and cultural). \n\uf02d In a second step, the participants are asked to develop strategies to make most out of the idea. \nAfterward, each group presents their results.\n\nThe first step to be able to identify good ideas is to assess their time-adjusted value. There are two key questions to ask, when making this assessment:\n\nHow valuable is the idea?\n\uf02d How differentiated is the product or service idea?\n\uf02d What is the future market size: how large is the market actually, how fast is it projected to grow?\n\uf02d Does the idea generate a new market? How large could this become?\n\uf02d When could the new product or service be launched?\n\nHow quickly does an idea lose value?\n\uf02d How quickly could the competitors respond?\n\uf02d How else could the benefit of the idea be delivered?\n\n2) The term \u201cvalue\u201d in social, economic and cultural terms:\nSocial and cultural value:\nSocial and cultural value is about people and the positive and nega-tive impact their actions have on other people, society, business, economy and the environment. Social value has an impact on health, wellbeing, diverse thinking and inclusion, innovation and on produc-tivity. Social value is not about \u201cdoing or being good\u201d. It is about the value people, the business sector and industry creates for the society, economy and environment. Social value underlines that all decisions and actions have an impact on other people, the society, economy and the environment. \nEconomic value: \nEconomic value is the value that a person attaches to a good or ser-vice based on the benefits they derive from it. In terms of evaluat-ing ideas, this means that an idea that has economic value has the potential to generate profits. The value of the win can be measured by how much money could be made. Ideally, the idea should create a sustainable profit over time. \n\n3) Appropriate license for the purpose of protecting the value created by an idea:\nTo protect an idea it is crucial to secure the appropriate type(s) of in-tellectual property, i.e. licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets. If the idea is not protected or not protected in the right way, the ownership of the idea could be loosed. A good overview on all forms of protecting ideas gives the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO, https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/). \nSTEP 3: Presentation and evaluation\nEach participant presents an idea based on which they can apply what they have learned about different values (social, economic and cultural) of ideas and licenses.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "Resources for the introduction:\n\n\uf02d Quality instead of quantity: Assessing ideas for innovations.
