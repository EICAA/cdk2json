You can decide to do them on separate days or do them all at once.                         \n                                                                                                                                                                                                               Day 0 \u2013 Innovation needs support: goal is to prevent the exercises and the activities of this program from being forgotten in your everyday life\nDay 1 \u2013 Innovation is everywhere: This exercise is designed to take away the unnecessary fear of dealing with innovation and to dare to innovate yourself. If you are wondering what an innovation actually is, then first of all just let your everyday understanding guide you and assume that the word part \u2018nova\u2019 (=new) in innovation is important.\nDay 2 \u2013 Failures are educational: Identifying successful innovations is a comparatively easy exercise, as you have already seen. A somewhat greater challenge is to remember your own failures or the flops of others. One\u2019s own failures are often banned from our active memory by repression mechanisms. However, this is not very helpful. It is a truism that you learn from mistakes. What may be new to you is that, scientifically proven, one some-times learns more from the mistakes of others than from one\u2019s own mistakes.\nDay 3 \u2013 Creative destruction: Creative or creational destruction describes the phenomenon of the new displacing the old. New technologies displace old technologies. New products displace old products. New companies displace old companies.\nDay 4 \u2013 Non-customer potential: You can learn and be inspired from this group of non-customers. Maybe these non-customers are presented from buying your products by certain barriers. Maybe these non-customers do not need your products because they have other means to solve the problems your product solves. Another reason could be that these non-customers do not value the benefits that your product \u2013 by which we mean goods and services \u2013 provides. By knowing the obstacles and barriers of your non-customers, you can derive innovation opportunities. \nDay 5 \u2013 Without exaggeration: The German economies owe a large part of their success, as they say, to the technical precision that characterizes many innovations. However, these masterpieces of engineering are disadvantageous for economic reasons if, firstly, customers do not or cannot appreciate this precision, or if, secondly, this precision manifests itself in a multitude of functions that are only used by a small number of customers.\nDay 6 \u2013 Arrrrrgh: The world would probably be (almost) perfect if all products worked the way the respective innovators imagined. Unfortunately \u2013 or perhaps thankfully \u2013, the world is not quite so perfect. This allows you to improve products continuously. Observe your customers interacting with your products.\nDay 7 \u2013 Future: Innovation always means dealing with the future. Innovation is not about generating sales and success with current activities. Rather, it is about laying the foundation for success in the future with today\u2019s activities.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful \u2013 and that\u2019s probably a clear understatement \u2013 to get involved with the future and try to figure out what the future might look like.\nDay 8 \u2013 The last day: Now it\u2019s time to reflect on these inspirations and ideas and put them into action.\nFor the presentation and eventually as an orientation for the implementation of an idea, you need a structure. The Business Model Canvas presented by Osterwalter and Pigneur (2010) provides a good structure with which innovations can also be represented well, since the questions posed by Osterwalder and Pigneur explain very well what is behind an idea.\n",

If you are wondering what an innovation actually is, then first of all just let your everyday understanding guide you and assume that the word part \u2018nova\u2019 (=new) in innovation is important.\nDay 2 \u2013 Failures are educational: Identifying successful innovations is a comparatively easy exercise, as you have already seen. A somewhat greater challenge is to remember your own failures or the flops of others. One\u2019s own failures are often banned from our active memory by repression mechanisms. However, this is not very helpful. It is a truism that you learn from mistakes. What may be new to you is that, scientifically proven, one some-times learns more from the mistakes of others than from one\u2019s own mistakes.\nDay 3 \u2013 Creative destruction: Creative or creational destruction describes the phenomenon of the new displacing the old. New technologies displace old technologies. New products displace old products. New companies displace old companies.\nDay 4 \u2013 Non-customer potential: You can learn and be inspired from this group of non-customers. Maybe these non-customers are presented from buying your products by certain barriers. Maybe these non-customers do not need your products because they have other means to solve the problems your product solves. Another reason could be that these non-customers do not value the benefits that your product \u2013 by which we mean goods and services \u2013 provides. By knowing the obstacles and barriers of your non-customers, you can derive innovation opportunities. \nDay 5 \u2013 Without exaggeration: The German economies owe a large part of their success, as they say, to the technical precision that characterizes many innovations. However, these masterpieces of engineering are disadvantageous for economic reasons if, firstly, customers do not or cannot appreciate this precision, or if, secondly, this precision manifests itself in a multitude of functions that are only used by a small number of customers.\nDay 6 \u2013 Arrrrrgh: The world would probably be (almost) perfect if all products worked the way the respective innovators imagined. Unfortunately \u2013 or perhaps thankfully \u2013, the world is not quite so perfect. This allows you to improve products continuously. Observe your customers interacting with your products.\nDay 7 \u2013 Future: Innovation always means dealing with the future. Innovation is not about generating sales and success with current activities. Rather, it is about laying the foundation for success in the future with today\u2019s activities.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful \u2013 and that\u2019s probably a clear understatement \u2013 to get involved with the future and try to figure out what the future might look like.\nDay 8 \u2013 The last day: Now it\u2019s time to reflect on these inspirations and ideas and put them into action.\nFor the presentation and eventually as an orientation for the implementation of an idea, you need a structure. The Business Model Canvas presented by Osterwalter and Pigneur (2010) provides a good structure with which innovations can also be represented well, since the questions posed by Osterwalder and Pigneur explain very well what is behind an idea.\n",

In entrepreneurship, originality comes from creating value for the customer/user, for the organization and/or for the society at large. In entrepreneurship, opportunity arises when there are unsolved problems (or unsatisfied needs) or when the existing solutions can be improved. This might imply not only the design of a new product or service, but a wider range of types of solutions, such as a new relationship with the customer, a new business model, improved processes in a company, etc.\nThus, we assume that the original idea is inspired by a problem, challenge or need of users, organizations and/or society. Consequently, the first step in the creative process is to determine this opportunity from a thorough understanding of the problem (or even discovering the problem). Consequently, the creative process starts with the identification of the problem from the point of view of the target group (i.e., user, group, society,\u2026). \nFrom now on, we will call the target group just \u201cuser\u201d, meaning that it could be a well-known group of users or potential users or other target groups (society, businesses, etc). After the problem is properly identified, the ideation phase takes place.\n\nPhase 1-User insights (problem/need understanding)\nThe process consists of a facilitated divergence/convergence process. In the divergence stage, different problem formulations are hypothesized, while in the convergence stage, the best problem formulations are synthesized. The following figure illustrates this phase:\n ##Picture1.3B1##  \n\u00a9 Entrepreneurship by Design with ToolBoard Canvas (Jaume Teodoro, 2022)\n\nThe output of the synthesis stage is called user insights. The insights provide the necessary inspiration for the next step, the generation of solution ideas. \nPhase 2 \u2013 Ideation (solution ideas)\nThe idea generation process consists of another cycle of divergent/convergent processes. In this case, different solution ideas are generated for each insight, with the focus on quantity rather than quality. Once a wide range of ideas is obtained, the best ones are chosen and others are discarded, based on given selection criteria. \nThis process does not imply that we should solve all problems for all types of users, nor select all potential solutions to given problems. The creative process at this point requires betting on a certain point of view about the problem and end up with a value proposition for the user.\nThe following figure illustrates this double process.\n  ##picture1.3B2##\n\u00a9 Entrepreneurship by Design with ToolBoard Canvas (Jaume Teodoro, 2022) adapted from British Design Council https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond \n\n\nPROCESS\nThe creative process requires freedom as well as a certain discipline if what is sought is to create a concept that is attractive to the user, as well as viable for the organization and feasible to carry out. In this sense, support in the form of a repository or visual map is essential. The Creativity Mural provides this support. This tool belongs to the book \u201cEntrepreneurship by design with ToolBoard Canvas\u201d (Jaume Teodoro, 2022)\u201d  \n##Picture1.3B3##\nStep 1:  Insight identification\nResearch techniques are developed by immersing with the user (ethnography) and in the environment (state of the art) to identify key knowledge about the user\u2019s need in relation to the problem or latent need to which a solution is desired. It is about converting a latent need into an explicit need (a well-posed problem). The team leaves the office and meets potential users. Listen and watch. You can use any (or several) of the ethnographic techniques described. Based on this research, the team generates observations. Then, the team gathers around the creativity mural and together they identify the user\u2019s insights.\nStep 2: Insight selection (design principles)\nThe insights generated are many. Now it's about making decisions. Bet to establish a point of view about what problem to face and for what type of clients. To do this, the team defines a type user (person) to whom it assigns insights. Unwanted insights are flagged. They are not deleted as the process is iterative and it may be used later on, in the process of iterating/pivoting/modifying the point of view.\nStep 3: Idea generation\nBased on the chosen insights (the so-called design principles), an idea generation session is prepared with some of the exposed techniques. For the session to work, some rules are agreed (do not criticize, do not play, do not edit the ideas) and sticky notes are used to relate ideas with insights. Before starting, you can do a warm-up session (for example, from reviewing the Brief, or stretching or ice-breaking exercises). Once this is done, it is about generating solution ideas related to the Insights. The creativity mural is used to place the generated ideas.\nStep 4: Idea selection\nSelect or combine the large set of ideas into a reduced set, by focusing on the creation of value. To do this, the team first analyzes the mural. By looking for patterns and repetitions, ideas are grouped. Once this is done, the team defines criteria for selecting the ideas. With these criteria, the main ideas are prioritized. In the mural this action corresponds to moving the key ideas to the central area of the mural and highlighting them.\nStep 5: Value Preposition\nThe value proposition is a call to action about the benefit(s) that the idea brings to the user. This is phased in a statement such as:\nWe help \u2026 [User] to \u2026 [Benefit] by doing .. [Solution]\n\nThe value proposition should be brief, concise and impressive. To do this, the statement includes the customer archetype (user), the benefit (need or problem to solve), and finally the solution, which is a way of grouping the main ideas that have been determined.\n\n",
      "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "USEFUL TIPS\n\u2022 It is important to follow the steps and to work in groups\n\u2022 It is required to work with collaborative online tools (Miro or Mural are good references)\n\u2022 A maximum of 5 groups simultaneously (20 students) for a teacher with experience in creativity\n\nRESOURCES FOR PHASE 1\na. Users research with ethnographic techniques\nEthnographic research is the main tool for generating customer insights based on what the customer needs, wants or longs for. A good approach is to understand or identify what causes the user\u2019s frustration, fears or expectations. Ethnographic research comprises a set of tools widely used in marketing and coming from anthropological research. The list of common tools is:\n- The in-depth interview is a type of interview with users and other stakeholders aimed at capturing observations about what they say, do, think and feel. \n- On-the-spot observation is another technique aimed at generating real knowledge.\n- Shadowing in this same line is a type of observation based on following users in what they do in relation to the topic to be investigated. On some occasions, the in-depth interview is complemented with focus groups aimed at capturing knowledge in groups of clients and other stakeholders. \n- Surveys can also be used to approach a large set of users.\n\nb. Research of the environment and state of the art\nState-of-the-art research consists of generating insights from the environment using different techniques. Typical techniques can be: market reports, expert interviews, value chain industry analysis, Porter\u2019s five forces analysis, and other resources. Techniques for systematic review of the literature are also included.\nc. Trend map\nIt consists of a visual about the trends that influence the topic being investigated. It is about analyzing social, political, economic, demographic and new technology issues. For doing it there are many divulgation reviews and trend digest web sites (trendwatching.com, springwise.com, trendsdigest.com, TechCrunch, Google Trends, \u2026)\nd. Identification of customer insights\nThe identification of user insights starts by linking the findings resulting from the users research with insights from the environment. It is a knowledge synthesis process that is carried out in a group by the entrepreneurial team. To do this, the team uses visual diagrams and sticky notes to identify typical users and their patterns.\nRESOURCES FOR PHASE 2\na. Idea generation techniques\nIt includes brainstorming and other techniques derived from it (brainwriting, edge storming, longlist, what if, reverse brainwriting, ...). In all cases, it is about taking inspiration from the user's insights (key knowledge about the need, challenge or problem) to generate a large number of ideas without establishing any limitations in terms of suitability, feasibility or viability at the moment. The bottom line is that the people involved in the process feel free to think and without limitations beyond following the Brief of the project, that is, the problem or need that is sought to be solved.\nb. Ideas selection techniques\nThe divergent process of idea generation is followed by a convergent process of idea selection. It is about choosing the best ideas based on given criteria. For example, impact, speed of bringing to market, technological knowledge, etc.\nc. Definition of the value proposition.\nThe value proposition is defined based on the benefit that the idea generates for the user. It basically formulates how the solution solves the identified problem. There are many techniques for defining the value proposition. Authors such as Steve Blanck, Geofrey Moore, Guy Kawasaki, and Alexander Osterwalder proposed different syntaxis. ",

In entrepreneurship, originality comes from creating value for the customer/user, for the organization and/or for the society at large. In entrepreneurship, opportunity arises when there are unsolved problems (or unsatisfied needs) or when the existing solutions can be improved. This might imply not only the design of a new product or service, but a wider range of types of solutions, such as a new relationship with the customer, a new business model, improved processes in a company, etc.\nThus, we assume that the original idea is inspired by a problem, challenge or need of users, organizations and/or society. Consequently, the first step in the creative process is to determine this opportunity from a thorough understanding of the problem (or even discovering the problem). Consequently, the creative process starts with the identification of the problem from the point of view of the target group (i.e., user, group, society,\u2026). \nFrom now on, we will call the target group just \u201cuser\u201d, meaning that it could be a well-known group of users or potential users or other target groups (society, businesses, etc). After the problem is properly identified, the ideation phase takes place.\n\nPhase 1-User insights (problem/need understanding)\nThe process consists of a facilitated divergence/convergence process. In the divergence stage, different problem formulations are hypothesized, while in the convergence stage, the best problem formulations are synthesized. The following figure illustrates this phase:\n ##Picture1.3B1##  \n\u00a9 Entrepreneurship by Design with ToolBoard Canvas (Jaume Teodoro, 2022)\n\nThe output of the synthesis stage is called user insights. The insights provide the necessary inspiration for the next step, the generation of solution ideas. \nPhase 2 \u2013 Ideation (solution ideas)\nThe idea generation process consists of another cycle of divergent/convergent processes. In this case, different solution ideas are generated for each insight, with the focus on quantity rather than quality. Once a wide range of ideas is obtained, the best ones are chosen and others are discarded, based on given selection criteria. \nThis process does not imply that we should solve all problems for all types of users, nor select all potential solutions to given problems. The creative process at this point requires betting on a certain point of view about the problem and end up with a value proposition for the user.\nThe following figure illustrates this double process.\n  ##picture1.3B2##\n\u00a9 Entrepreneurship by Design with ToolBoard Canvas (Jaume Teodoro, 2022) adapted from British Design Council https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond \n\n\nPROCESS\nThe creative process requires freedom as well as a certain discipline if what is sought is to create a concept that is attractive to the user, as well as viable for the organization and feasible to carry out. In this sense, support in the form of a repository or visual map is essential. The Creativity Mural provides this support. This tool belongs to the book \u201cEntrepreneurship by design with ToolBoard Canvas\u201d (Jaume Teodoro, 2022)\u201d  \n##Picture1.3B3##\nStep 1:  Insight identification\nResearch techniques are developed by immersing with the user (ethnography) and in the environment (state of the art) to identify key knowledge about the user\u2019s need in relation to the problem or latent need to which a solution is desired. It is about converting a latent need into an explicit need (a well-posed problem). The team leaves the office and meets potential users. Listen and watch. You can use any (or several) of the ethnographic techniques described. Based on this research, the team generates observations. Then, the team gathers around the creativity mural and together they identify the user\u2019s insights.\nStep 2: Insight selection (design principles)\nThe insights generated are many. Now it's about making decisions. Bet to establish a point of view about what problem to face and for what type of clients. To do this, the team defines a type user (person) to whom it assigns insights. Unwanted insights are flagged. They are not deleted as the process is iterative and it may be used later on, in the process of iterating/pivoting/modifying the point of view.\nStep 3: Idea generation\nBased on the chosen insights (the so-called design principles), an idea generation session is prepared with some of the exposed techniques. For the session to work, some rules are agreed (do not criticize, do not play, do not edit the ideas) and sticky notes are used to relate ideas with insights. Before starting, you can do a warm-up session (for example, from reviewing the Brief, or stretching or ice-breaking exercises). Once this is done, it is about generating solution ideas related to the Insights. The creativity mural is used to place the generated ideas.\nStep 4: Idea selection\nSelect or combine the large set of ideas into a reduced set, by focusing on the creation of value. To do this, the team first analyzes the mural. By looking for patterns and repetitions, ideas are grouped. Once this is done, the team defines criteria for selecting the ideas. With these criteria, the main ideas are prioritized. In the mural this action corresponds to moving the key ideas to the central area of the mural and highlighting them.\nStep 5: Value Preposition\nThe value proposition is a call to action about the benefit(s) that the idea brings to the user. This is phased in a statement such as:\nWe help \u2026 [User] to \u2026 [Benefit] by doing .. [Solution]\n\nThe value proposition should be brief, concise and impressive. To do this, the statement includes the customer archetype (user), the benefit (need or problem to solve), and finally the solution, which is a way of grouping the main ideas that have been determined.\n\n",

Users research with ethnographic techniques\nEthnographic research is the main tool for generating customer insights based on what the customer needs, wants or longs for. A good approach is to understand or identify what causes the user\u2019s frustration, fears or expectations. Ethnographic research comprises a set of tools widely used in marketing and coming from anthropological research. The list of common tools is:\n- The in-depth interview is a type of interview with users and other stakeholders aimed at capturing observations about what they say, do, think and feel. \n- On-the-spot observation is another technique aimed at generating real knowledge.\n- Shadowing in this same line is a type of observation based on following users in what they do in relation to the topic to be investigated. On some occasions, the in-depth interview is complemented with focus groups aimed at capturing knowledge in groups of clients and other stakeholders. \n- Surveys can also be used to approach a large set of users.\n\nb. Research of the environment and state of the art\nState-of-the-art research consists of generating insights from the environment using different techniques. Typical techniques can be: market reports, expert interviews, value chain industry analysis, Porter\u2019s five forces analysis, and other resources. Techniques for systematic review of the literature are also included.\nc. Trend map\nIt consists of a visual about the trends that influence the topic being investigated. It is about analyzing social, political, economic, demographic and new technology issues. For doing it there are many divulgation reviews and trend digest web sites (trendwatching.com, springwise.com, trendsdigest.com, TechCrunch, Google Trends, \u2026)\nd. Identification of customer insights\nThe identification of user insights starts by linking the findings resulting from the users research with insights from the environment. It is a knowledge synthesis process that is carried out in a group by the entrepreneurial team. To do this, the team uses visual diagrams and sticky notes to identify typical users and their patterns.\nRESOURCES FOR PHASE 2\na. Idea generation techniques\nIt includes brainstorming and other techniques derived from it (brainwriting, edge storming, longlist, what if, reverse brainwriting, ...). In all cases, it is about taking inspiration from the user's insights (key knowledge about the need, challenge or problem) to generate a large number of ideas without establishing any limitations in terms of suitability, feasibility or viability at the moment. The bottom line is that the people involved in the process feel free to think and without limitations beyond following the Brief of the project, that is, the problem or need that is sought to be solved.\nb. Ideas selection techniques\nThe divergent process of idea generation is followed by a convergent process of idea selection. It is about choosing the best ideas based on given criteria. For example, impact, speed of bringing to market, technological knowledge, etc.\nc. Definition of the value proposition.\nThe value proposition is defined based on the benefit that the idea generates for the user. It basically formulates how the solution solves the identified problem. There are many techniques for defining the value proposition. Authors such as Steve Blanck, Geofrey Moore, Guy Kawasaki, and Alexander Osterwalder proposed different syntaxis. ",

The participants will learn about the different ways of sharing and protecting ideas and how to use them.\n\nSTEP 3: Presentation and evaluation\n\nEach participant elaborates an idea and visualizes the identified benefits and how the idea can be shared and protected digitally and legally.

      "instructor_manual_": "The module \u201cValuing ideas\u201d is based on recognizing the value creation potential of an idea and identifying suitable ways of exploiting the idea by developing an intellectual property strategy tailored to the respective idea.\nSince this module consists of three different performance levels, the teaching and learning methods differ.\nIntermediate level: \nSTEP 1: The intermediate level starts with an overview on the main topics:\n\uf02d How can an idea be valuated?\n\uf02d What means the term \u201cvalue\u201d in social, economic and cultural terms?\n\uf02d What is the most appropriate license for the purpose of protecting the value created by an idea?\nBackground material is available in the resource section below.\n\nSTEP 2: Task for the participants\n1) Valuation of an idea:\nAn entrepreneurial mindset means making the best of ideas and op-portunities. However, having a brilliant idea is not enough. Often even brilliant and excellent ideas are dismissed because investors and customers cannot see the potential and the value of the idea. It is therefore crucial not only to generate new ideas, but also to eval-uate what potential they have (economically, socially and cultural-ly).\nHere are two examples for exercises: \nExercise 1:\nSplit the class into four or five groups (depends on the size of participants). Let them think of ideas and let them spend five minutes on the idea, brain-storming on the following parameters: \n\uf02d What facts do we know about the idea?\n\uf02d What is positive about the idea?\n\uf02d What is negative?\n\uf02d What kind of feelings do the participants have when they realise the idea?\nAfterward, each group presents their answers and conclusions. \nThe aim of this exercise is to be conscious, that every idea has different points and aspects. \n\nExercise 2:\n\uf02d In a first step, let the participants in groups create a mind map with different aspects of an idea and what aspects should be considered (economic, social and cultural). \n\uf02d In a second step, the participants are asked to develop strategies to make most out of the idea. \nAfterward, each group presents their results.\n\nThe first step to be able to identify good ideas is to assess their time-adjusted value. There are two key questions to ask, when making this assessment:\n\nHow valuable is the idea?\n\uf02d How differentiated is the product or service idea?\n\uf02d What is the future market size: how large is the market actually, how fast is it projected to grow?\n\uf02d Does the idea generate a new market? How large could this become?\n\uf02d When could the new product or service be launched?\n\nHow quickly does an idea lose value?\n\uf02d How quickly could the competitors respond?\n\uf02d How else could the benefit of the idea be delivered?\n\n2) The term \u201cvalue\u201d in social, economic and cultural terms:\nSocial and cultural value:\nSocial and cultural value is about people and the positive and nega-tive impact their actions have on other people, society, business, economy and the environment. Social value has an impact on health, wellbeing, diverse thinking and inclusion, innovation and on produc-tivity. Social value is not about \u201cdoing or being good\u201d. It is about the value people, the business sector and industry creates for the society, economy and environment. Social value underlines that all decisions and actions have an impact on other people, the society, economy and the environment. \nEconomic value: \nEconomic value is the value that a person attaches to a good or service based on the benefits they derive from it. In terms of evaluating ideas, this means that an idea that has economic value has the potential to generate profits. The value of the win can be measured by how much money could be made. Ideally, the idea should create a sustainable profit over time. \n\n3) Appropriate license for the purpose of protecting the value created by an idea:\nTo protect an idea it is crucial to secure the appropriate type(s) of in-tellectual property, i.e. licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets. If the idea is not protected or not protected in the right way, the ownership of the idea could be loosed. A good overview on all forms of protecting ideas gives the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO, https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/). \nSTEP 3: Presentation and evaluation\nEach participant presents an idea based on which they can apply what they have learned about different values (social, economic and cultural) of ideas and licenses.",

For example, phase Learning is happening along the process. However, it might be helpful that the facilitator provides time to the students to identify and reflect about their learnings. That is why it is important that the facilitator has these phases in mind. Transference refers to the ability of applying the learnings of the lesson to thinking and behaviour of their participant in real scenarios, beyond the scenarios and the cases worked in class.\nThe contents of each session are detailed as follows.\n\nSESSION 1 \u2013 Introduction to ethical thinking & behaviour \n\nThe aim of this module is to make participants gain awareness on the importance of ethics in entrepreneurship and to be able to reason and behave ethically in life. \n\n1.1. What is ethics?\nThe session can start by asking the participants to provide a definition for ethics in their own words. Each participant can write their own ideas in a post-it and then, read them aloud. Then, the instructor can provide several definitions coming from literature (e.g., Farrell, 2017, p.3):\n\n\u2022 \u201cAccording to Toffler (1986) ethical questions have to do with the notions of right and wrong as noted by the perspectives of individuals and institutions in the society they are in.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to reach a common understanding of what ethics is. Also, the instructor can bring the topic of ethical conflict by providing a definition and asking the participants to provide examples of ethical conflicts in business and entrepreneurship. \n\n\u2022 Def. Ethical conflict: \u201cAn individual perceives that his/her duties and responsibilities towards one group are inconsistent with his/her responsibilities towards some other group including one\u2019s self\u201d (Hunt et al., 1984, p.310).\n\n1.2. Drawing your Personal Values\n\nEthics is also related to honesty, integrity and behaving according to their own values. In this part of the session, the participants are asked to list their core values and draw them in a mind map. In this mind map, the participants write their name (or drawing or picture) in the centre and around the name, they list the key values that drive their thought and behaviour. For each core value, the participants are asked to provide a sentence or slogan that describes that value. \n\nThe participants can show and pitch their drawing to the rest of the group. As a final reflection, the instructor asks the participants about the differences between behaving according to their values and behaving ethically. The following text may help guide the discussion:\n\n\u2022 \u201cActing with integrity means acting according to your own personal set of values and principles, which are different for everyone. Behaving ethically means behaving according to a set of standards that are the same for everyone, at least for everyone in the same culture. Acting with integrity and behaving ethically build your credibility.\u201d (Cole, 2013, p. 177)\n\n1.3. Identifying moral wrongs\nFollowing the discussion on the differences between personal values and ethical principles, the instructor asks the participants to identify ethical standards that are commonly agreed on a given culture. \n\nFor this purpose, the participants are asked to write a list of moral wrongs, i.e., list of behaviours that are generally considered as wrong behaviours in our culture (i.e., \u201ccheating in an exam\u201d). To help the participants come up with a long list, these can be divided in several domains:\n\n\u2022 Academic settings\n\u2022 Social situations\n\u2022 Business\n\u2022 Sports\n\u2022 Workplace\n\u2022 Environment\n\nThe participants can work in teams and then, share their answers with the whole group. The instructor moderates the discussion.\n\nThe instructor can access a list of moral wrongs in https://utas.shorthandstories.com/PP_Ethics/index.html \n\n1.4. Personal reflection\nTo close the session, the participants are invited to reflect critically on their own (current and past) behaviour. This can be done off-session, by taking notes in a diary.\n\nSome guiding questions can be provided to help participants interpret their actions in an ethical way (see the Ethics Centre):\n1. Would I be happy for this decision to be headlining the news tomorrow? (\u201cSunlight Test\u201d)\n2. Is there an ethical non-negotiable at play?\n3. Will my action make the world a better place?\n4. What would happen if everybody did this?\n5. What will this do to my character or the character of my organisation?\n6. Is this consistent with my values and principles?\n1.5. Closing\nThe facilitator asks the participants to summarise the learnings of the lesson in one sentence, write this down in a notebook and then, share it aloud with the remaining participants. This practice helps the participant review the contents and learnings of the class, and generates higher commitment by sharing these learnings with peers.\n\u2026\u2026..\n\nSESSION 2- Introduction to accountability\nThe aim of this session is to raise awareness on the concept of accountability among the participants, applied to scenarios of everyday life.\n\n2.1. Story\nThe facilitator starts by telling a story about accountability. The story can refer to a common scenario related to the audience. \n\nFor example, if the audience consists of students, the story could be:\n\u201cJohn is studying a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. In order to gain some financial independence, he decided to take a job every afternoon, from 3-7pm. When he arrives at home, he is too tired to study or work on the assignments from university. During the weekend, he often procrastinates and tries to catch up with his assignments on late Sunday. The quality of his work is often not good enough, although he is not aware of it. When the deadline for one of the assignments is approaching, he complains that the professor gives too much work and asks him for an extended deadline, but the professor rejects his demand. He finally fails the assignment and becomes very angry. He decides to write a complaint to the Dean with his version of the story and the professor is called to the Dean\u2019s office to provide explanation of what happened.\u201d \n\nIn the context of an organisation, the facilitator can make up a similar story with an employee and her boss.\n\nStorytelling fosters more engagement among the participants and helps break the ice so that the participants can participate early in the session. After the story, the facilitator can ask several questions for discussion: \n\n\u2022 What is John\u2019s behaviour?\n\u2022 What are the consequences of his behaviour?\n\u2022 Could John have behave differently and how?\n\u2022 From John\u2019s perspective, who is the responsible that he failed the assignment?\n\u2022 Is John aware of his accountability?\n\u2022 How would you define accountability?\n\n2.2. What is accountability?\nIn this part of the session, the facilitator provides definitions to accountability:\n\n\u2022 Accountability is an obligation to inform about, and justify one\u2019s conduct to an authority (Novelli et al., 2022). \n\n\u2022 More formally, accountability denotes a relation between an agent A and (what is usually called) a forum F, such that A must justify A\u2019s conduct to F, and F supervises, asks questions to, and passes judgement on A on the basis of such justification (Bovens 2007, 450). Both A and F need not be natural, individual persons, and may be groups or legal persons (Novelli et al., 2022).\n\n\nAlthough these definitions might be a bit technical, the definitions may help the participant to reason about the case with more tools. The facilitator can relate the definitions to the case just exposed and ask the following questions:\n\u2022 Who is the \u201caccountable agent A\u201d in the previous story?\n\u2022 Who is the authority in this case?\n\u2022 What are the A\u2019s tasks and responsibilities?\n\u2022 What evidence can the authority gather to pass a judgement on A?\n\u2022 What are the learnings for A?\n\nAccountability can also be related to the context of delegation (see Novelli et al., 2022 for details). \n\n2.3. The Accountability Pathway\nThe Accountability Pathway approach considers accountability as a process consisting on eight phases (Jolie Bain Pillsbury, n.d.).\n1. Unaware\n2. Blame Oth\u00acers\n3. \u201cI Can\u2019t\u201d Excuses\n4. Wait and Hope\n5. Acknowl\u00acedge Reality\n6. Own Action Commitment\n7. Find Solu\u00actions\n8. Make It Happen\nBefore introducing the Accountability Pathway, the facilitator can ask the students to classify these actions in accountable or non-accountable and then, sort them in ascending order from less to more accountability. This concept can be again related to the study case, by asking in which state of accountability John is.\n\nSee pictures and templates in http://www.sherbrookeconsulting.com/products.htm \n\n2.4. Identifying your accountability\nThis is a personal reflection exercise, where the participant is invited to reflect on their own (current or past) responsibilities and commitments, evaluate the degree of completion and then, reflect on their development stage with respect to the accountability pathway.\nThe task is as follows:\n1. Write a list of all your main responsibilities/tasks (at home, work, university)\n2. Write a list of other commitments that you have made with others (friends, relatives, colleagues, your boss, etc).\n3. If applicable, write the start date, deadline (if any) and the level of completion/achievement of these tasks and commitments.\n4. What actions are you taking in each task or commitment? \n5. What are the consequences of these actions (or lack of action)?\n6. Finally, reflect on it. Do you see any general pattern or behaviour?\n7. Where are you in the accountability pathway?\n8. What can you do to progress along the accountability pathway?\n\nSee \u201cAccountability Awareness\u201d template.\n\n2.5. Closing\nThe facilitator asks the participants to summarise the learnings of the lesson and share it aloud with the remaining participants. In order to introduce some innovation, the facilitator can ask the participants to draw the learning rather than writing, which was done in the previous session.\n.....\nSESSION 3- Introduction to sustainability\nThe goal of this session is to raise awareness on economic progress and its impact on sustainability and society by providing food for thought and opportunities for reflection and discussion.\n3.1. Awareness\nThe session can start by raising awareness about the consequences of current progress to the environment and the society. One way of raising awareness is to watch a conference or documentary in the session.\nExamples:\nImpact over the environment (landscape): Pictures and documentary by Edward Burtynsky (photographer):\n\u2022 Manufactured Landscapes documentary (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufactured_Landscapes) \n\u2022 TED Talk: Manufactured landscapes and green education: https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_burtynsky_my_wish_manufactured_landscapes_and_green_education \n\u2022 TED Talk, Landscape of oil: https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_burtynsky_photographing_the_landscape_of_oil\nImpact on society:\n\u2022 Workers (1993), photographs by Sebastian Salgado on the extreme working conditions of men and women around the world (often in underdeveloped countries): https://www.polkagalerie.com/en/sebastiao-salgado-works-genesis.htm \nAfter watching the videos, the facilitator can ask the participants to share their opinions around economic progress and the impact on society and the environment. \n3.2. Sustainability\nIn this part of the session, the facilitator can provide inputs on the definition of sustainability and the three pillars of sustainable development, as it can be seen below.\nThe report \u201cOur common future\u201d defines sustainable development as:\n\u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d\nThe report was published in October 1987 by the United Nations through Oxford University Press. It is also known as the Brundtland Report, named after Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who led the World Commission on Environment and Development. It can be accessed through the link:\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common-future.pdf\nThere are three (+1) pillars of sustainable development:\n\u2022 Social sustainability: in broad terms, this pillar refers to the preservation of human rights, basic needs, and well-being of all people, encompassing issues such as access to food and water, education and health.\n\u2022 Environmental sustainability: keeping in balance all earth\u2019s environmental systems, while natural resources within them are consumed by humans at a rate in which they are able to replenish themselves.\n\u2022 Economic sustainability: human communities across the globe are able to maintain their independence and have access to resources that they require, financial or other, to meet their needs (Univ Alberta). Economic developments can accelerate social development by providing opportunities for underprivileged groups or by spreading education more rapidly (our common future, Chapter 2 http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm )\n\u2022 In the last years, culture has been emphasized as the fourth pillar of sustainability. Culture can be defined as the beliefs and attitudes about something that people in a particular group or organization share (Oxford\u2019s dictionary). Culture represents a particular way of perceiving, knowing and interacting with the environment. There is a knowledge that comes from culture which is expected to last as long as the race or institution exists.\nThis input can set the basis for the next input on SDGs. To make the session more interactive, the facilitator can ask the students to work on one of these pillars. As follows, there is an example of an activity that can be done in the pillar of social progress.\n3.3. Social Progress\nThis part of the session proposes an activity to work more deeply in one of the pillars, social progress (similar activities could be held in the other pillars as well):\n\u2022 Reading an article about economic progress and social progress: \u201cWhy social progress matters\u201d by World Economic Forum (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/04/why-social-progress-matters/)\n\u2022 Ask the participants to list a set of aspects or factors that are related to the social progress of a community. For example, health, education.\n\u2022 The facilitator introduces the Social Progress Index (SPI). Reference of the methodology: https://www.socialprogress.org/2020-Social-Progress-Index-Methodology.pdf \n\u2022 The facilitator can show the Social Index report with the results of the latest SPI measured across all countries: https://www.socialprogress.org/index/global/results; https://www.socialprogress.org/\n3.4. Exercise\nIn this exercise, the participants work in teams. The participants are asked to identify a set of practices connected to their everyday lives that are sustainable and not sustainable, categorised under the four pillars identified before (economic, social, environmental and cultural). This can be written and shared with post-its. After the exercise, each team selects and prepares a pitch for one sustainable and non-sustainable practice in each of the four pillars.\n3.5. Introduction to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nThe SDGs enshrine a conceptual shift in thinking about development beyond economic growth \u2014 envisioning a desirable future that is equitable, inclusive, peaceful, and environmentally sustainable. The 17 SDGs represent an urgent call to action at global scale structured in the three pillars, i.e., social, environmental and economic. Recently, culture has been recognized to be at the heart of development policies within the framework of SDGs (Hosagrahar, 2017).\nThe facilitator can introduce the 17 SDGs and then, ask the participants to revise the previous exercise and match the sustainable and unsustainable practices to one or several SDGs.\n3.6. Closing\nThe facilitator asks the participants to summarise the learnings of the lesson and share it aloud with the remaining participants. \n\nResources and references for sessions 1-2:\nCole, K.

      "instructor_manual_": "The learning methodology is based on the following phases:\nA. Inspiration and awareness\nB. Hands-on experience\nC. Reflection\nD. Sharing and discussion with peers\nE. Learning\nF. Transference\nThe phases do not need to follow a linear order. For example, phase Learning is happening along the process. However, it might be helpful that the facilitator provides time to the students to identify and reflect about their learnings. That is why it is important that the facilitator has these phases in mind. Transference refers to the ability of applying the learnings of the lesson to thinking and behaviour of their participant in real scenarios, beyond the scenarios and the cases worked in class.\n\nThe contents of each session are detailed as follows.\n\n\n1. Introduction to ethics and sustainability\nThe instructor can introduce the session by asking the participants to define ethics and then, providing some definitions. The following paragraph from Farrell (2018) might provide a good context:\n\nThe word ethics comes from the Greek words ethos and ethikos. According to Toffler (1986) ethos is translated as character and ethikos as \u201cthe theory of living\u201d. Ethics were defined as \u201crules or standards\u201d and morality as \u201crelating to principles of right and wrong\u201d. Most definitions of ethics have to do with the idea of actions either being right or wrong (Morris et al., 2002, p332). According to Toffler (1986) ethical questions have to do with the notions of right and wrong as noted by the perspectives of individuals and institutions in the society they are in. Therefore, ethics deals with the distinction between what is right and wrong and has to do with the nature and grounds of morality, including moral judgements, standards and rules of conduct (Taylor, 1975). Ethical management is reflected in the character of the manager and through the work ethic and decision-making\u201d (Farrell, 2018, p. 3)\n\nIn this session, the participants will identify ethical dilemmas that entrepreneurs often face and reflect on potential dilemmas that they might be facing. Thus, before working on ethical dilemmas, the instructor can ask again the participants for definitions of \u201cethical dilemma\u201d. After the interchange of ideas among the participants, the instructor can refer to Farrell\u2019s (2018) review of entrepreneurial dilemma:\n\n\u201cThere can be ethical conflict when \u201can individual perceives that his/her duties and responsibilities towards one group are inconsistent with his/her responsibilities towards some other group including one\u2019s self\u201d (Hunt et al., 1984, p.310). According to Liedtka (1989) there can be two types of conflict: conflict within the individual resulting from the individual\u2019s value hierarchy, and conflict between individual values and organisational values. Friedman (1997) says that stockholder theory states that managers (as agents of stockholders) should behave in a manner that conforms to the basic rules of society, as embodied in law and ethical custom.\u201d (Farrell, 2018, p.5).\n\nFinally, to include sustainability as part of the ethical dilemmas that some businesses and entrepreneurs might face, the instructor can foster contributions from the participants to definitions for sustainability. Some definitions provided by some authors are:\n- \u201cThe possibility that humans and other life will flourish on earth forever\u201d (Ehrenfeld, 2008, p.49; cited in Farrell, 2018)\n- \u201cDevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d (Our Common Future, n.d.).\n\n2. Ethical challenges in business\n\nTo introduce the topic of ethics in business and entrepreneurship, the instructor can show the following video:\n\n\u2022 The Slippery slope to major fraud-Diann Cattani: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvQEwT5_uFw \n\nAlso, some cases can be presented to raise awareness:\n\n\u2022 New York department stores:\nPrestigious New York department stores, several of our respondents told us, cavalierly break promises to suppliers.\n\u201cYou send the department store an invoice for $55,000 and they send you $38,000. If you question it they say, \u2018Here is an $11,000 penalty for being two days late; here is the transportation tax and a dockage fee\u2026you didn\u2019t follow our shipping instructions, Clause 42, Section 3C. You used the wrong carrier.\u2019 And half the time they call the order in and send the 600-page confirming document later, and they say you didn\u2019t follow our order.\u201d (Bhid\u00e9 & Stevenson, 1990)\n- Other cases can be found in Bhid\u00e9 & Stevenson\u2019s (1990) article: \u201cWhy Be Honest if Honesty Doesn\u2019t Pay\u201d published in Harvard Business Review.\n3. Ethical challenges in entrepreneurship\n\nTo focus the topic of ethical behaviour in entrepreneurship, the instructor can refer to extant research on whether entrepreneurs are more/less driven by ethical values than managers and what ethical difficulties they may face in their new ventures. Hannafey (2003) suggests that ethical thinking and behaviour may be challenging for entrepreneurs who often struggle with conditions of significant business and moral uncertainty. He identifies several areas where entrepreneurs could face ethical dilemmas: \n\uf0a7 Social effects: These may include economic harm, and environmental degradation.\n\uf0a7 Direct financial gain: Entrepreneurs often face severe capital and liquidity constraints. This may influence the entrepreneurs\u2019 moral perceptions and judgements about financial matters. \n\uf0a7 Relationships: Personal relations (friends, family, employees, investors and others) may be influenced along the development of the new venture. There might be special complications when family members and friends lend money to the new venture. Other ethical dilemmas may arise if entrepreneurs relate to others in transactional or instrumental ways.\n\uf0a7 Promotion of the venture: This includes the dilemma of how much information to disclose about the venture, tactics used to influence investment, and bargaining tactics (Hannafey 2003, pp. 102-5).\nKirk Hanson (2015), author of the article \u201cA Good Start: Ethics for Entrepreneurs-Eleven Key Steps\u201d suggests eleven key steps for new ventures to take ethics into account. The first step is:\n1. Recognise the ethical dilemmas that surround them in the first few months. That is, entrepreneurs keep in mind that things can get difficult in the first while, and put ethical practices into place right from the start.\nSome of the ethical dilemmas that entrepreneurs may face, as mentioned by the author are:\n\u201cHow much puffery do you use in presenting your idea to venture capitalists? How do you divide stock ownership and options fairly among the founding team and later hires? How reliable does a product have to be before you ship it? How creative can you be in your accounting when the value of your stock is so sensitive to a stumble? When a deal falls through, how quickly do you tell your board and your funders? How generous can you afford to be in employee benefits in the early days?\u201d (Hanson, 2015).\n4. \u201cMy entrepreneurial dilemmas\u201d\nBased on Hanson\u2019s suggestion, the instructor asks the participants to identify the ethical and sustainability dilemmas that they face in their value creating activity or new venture. Every participant is invited to write a list of the dilemmas in their new venture. Participants can read the list aloud to share it with the whole group or do so in small teams of three or four people.\nThe aim of this activity is to raise awareness among the participants of the ethical dilemmas that they might be facing as entrepreneurs, employees, or citizens.  \n5. Entrepreneurial dilemma: awareness\nOnce the participants have identified some ethical and sustainability dilemmas, they are asked to select one, which could be the most critical one according to their own judgement. For a given dilemma, the participant is asked to:\n- identify the stakeholders affected by these dilemmas, including the society and the environment, \n- reflect on different solutions and \n- their potential effects.\nTo guide the participants through the process, they can fill the template \u201cEntrepreneurial Ethical Dilemma\u201d (section \u201cAwareness\u201d).  The participants can work on more than one dilemma if they want to.\nFinally, sharing all the ideas and listening to others\u2019 reflections is very beneficial to broaden the different perspectives and further develop empathy.\n6. Entrepreneurial dilemma: From awareness to commitment to action\nBeyond ethical awareness, behaving ethically involves deciding the right action and being committed to it. \nAccording to Trevi\u00f1o and Brown (2004), there are four stages required to behave ethically:\n1. Becoming aware that there is a moral issue.\n2. Making a judgment \u2013 that is, deciding which specific action is morally justifiable.\n3. Becoming motivated \u2013 committing or intending to take the moral action.\n4. Showing moral character \u2013 actually following through.\nBased on this reflection, every participant is now invited to select one of the dilemmas that they worked previously, and complete steps 2-3 of this process. This means that after pondering the different actions and their consequences, the participant needs to decide on the best course of action and commit themselves to the corresponding actions. The participants are invited to fill in the template \u201cEntrepreneurial Ethical Dilemma\u201d, sections \u201cJudgement\u201d and \u201cCommitment\u201d.\n7. Learnings\nTo close the session, every participant is invited to share their own learnings (takeaways) of the session.\n8. Further Reflection & Learning Transference\nBefore closing the session, the instructor asks the participants to read the article \u201cA Good Start: Ethics for Entrepreneurs-Eleven Key Steps\u201d by Hanson (2015). The instructor invites participants to plan actions that commit to these steps in their new ventures. \n\n",

Learning\nF. Transference\n\nThe phases do not need to follow a linear order. For example, phase Learning is happening along the process. However, it might be helpful that the facilitator provides time to the students to identify and reflect about their learnings. That is why it is important that the facilitator has these phases in mind. Transference refers to the ability of applying the learnings of the lesson to thinking and behaviour of their participant in real scenarios, beyond the scenarios and the cases worked in class.\n\nThe contents of each session are detailed as follows.\n1. Introduction\nThe goal of this session is to raise awareness on sustainability issues associated to the new venture and to provide methods and tools to assess and measure impact. Additionally, the participants will learn the differences between inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts and will be able to identify how the value proposal (new venture) develops in these aspects.\n2. Sustainability and entrepreneurship\nThe instructor starts the session by inspiring participants on the need of tackling sustainability, given the current societal and environmental challenges.\nNext, the instructor can mention examples of the current shift of today\u2019s businesses and organisations from an economic focus towards a more responsible and sustainable focus:\n\u2022 The Net Positive Manifesto (Polman & Winston, 2021): https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-net-positive-manifesto \n\u2022 Coca-Cola\u2019s sustainable business: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/sustainable-business \n\u2022 Amazon Sustainability: https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/ \n\u2022  Meta\u2019s Sustainability Report : https://sustainability.fb.com/2021-sustainability-report/ \nAlso, entrepreneurship is affected by this shift in many aspects:\n\u2022 It\u2019s Official: Customers prefer sustainable companies (Houlihan & Harvey, 2018) https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324001 \n\u2022 Why Startups Can\u2019t Afford To Ignore Sustainability In 2021 (Dyrnes, 2021): https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/01/07/why-startups-cant-afford-to-ignore-sustainability-in-2021/ \nAccording to The Net Positive Manifesto (Polman & Winston, 2021):\n\u2022 Companies must take ownership of all company impacts\n\u2022 Net positive companies propose solutions rather than wait for regulations\n\u2022 For their own good, companies must play an active role in solving our biggest shared challenges.\nThe session follows by a hands-on activity whose title is extracted from The Net Positive Manifesto.\n3. \u201cIs the world better off because your company is in it?\u201d \u2013 A Hands-on activity\nTo introduce the activity, the instructor reviews the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, n.d.; UNDP, 2022) and reviews them according to the three areas: economic, environmental and societal. \n\n##picture1.6A_1###\nFigure 1: The 17 Goals (United Nations, n.d.).\n\nAn alternative representation of SDGs is provided by the Wedding Cake Model, which emphasizes the hierarchy of SDGs goals (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.):\n1. Basis: a healthy biosphere\n2. Fair society\n3. Economy\n\n##picture1.6A_2##\nFigure 2: The SDGs wedding cake (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.. Credit: Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University CC BY-ND 3.0.\n\nAfter this introduction, the participants are invited to go through the SDGs and select the SDGs (maximum, three) in which their new venture is going to have a greater impact. For each SDG, the participants are required to specify which concrete solutions can create an impact. For example, if \u201cClimate action\u201d is selected in a new venture, some actions could be:\n\u2022 Use of recyclable materials\n\u2022 Green mobility in deliveries to customer\n Every solution should be written in a post-it.\nThe aim of this activity is to raise awareness of the solutions that can be implemented to foster sustainability in a new venture.\n4. Inputs-Outputs-Outcomes-Impacts\nThe terms outputs, outcomes and impact are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings. See the following extract from Phineo (2017):\n\u201cIn order to be able to achieve these objectives (target group\u2019s needs or identified opportunity), certain inputs (resources) must be available. From these resources, the project produces outputs (products and services). If these are utilized by the target individuals, this provides a foundation for achieving the desired results at the target-group level (outcomes). Results at the target-group level can in the next step contribute to results at the societal level (impact). This leads to a change in societal conditions, which in turn may generate new needs\u2026\u201d (p. 45).\n5. \u201cIdentify your IOOI\u201d. Hands-on activity\nFollowing the previous hands-on activity, participants are now asked to: \n\u2022 Identify the inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts of a solution, value proposition or new venture on a target group, the society and the environment.\nTo do that, the participants can use the impact staircase (see below). Every input is written in a post-it on the corresponding level of the staircase. Alternatively, you can use the Template Results staircase (Phineo, 2017).\n\n##picture1.6A_3##\nFigure 3: Impact staircase. Source: Phineo (2017).\n\n6. Defining Indicators and monitoring progress. Hands-on activity\nOnce the desired IOOIs are identified in the impact staircase, the participants should provide indicators to measure whether the intended goals are achieved. Indicators can be seen as \u201cevidence\u201d of achievement. \nIndicators should be defined in the planning phase, to set the degree of achievement that is required. During the new venture\u2019s development, indicators are an important instrument to monitor progress and learn from it. Indicators should be defined for the various levels of the staircase.\nAccording to the provided template, an indicator should fulfil a given aim or goal at a certain level (input, output, outcome, impact). Every indicator should have a target value (desired result) and a baseline value (departing point). The indicators and target values are to be measured on a given period of time to allow for monitoring and learning.\n\n##picture 1.6A_4##\nFigure 4: Template Indicators (Phineo,2017).\n\nSee Phineo (2017) for a detailed explanation about setting indicators for IOOIs.\nImpact metrics can also be specified in the Lean Impact Canvas. The Lean Impact Canvas is an adaptation of the Lean Canvas (Maurya, 2015). It contains two new segments: purpose and impact metrics. Purpose refers to the mission of the new venture or organisation (i.e., \u201cWhat is the intendent positive impact of the new venture on people and the environment?). Impact metrics are measurable and objective data that can be designed and measured to account for the intended purpose. See below.\n\n##picture1.6A_5##\nFigure 5: Lean Impact Canvas.

      "instructor_manual_": "INFORMATION & PREPARATION FOR THE EDUCATOR/TRAINER:\nThis module introduces a range of tools and topics relevant to digital skills development, with a focus on their application in participants\u2019 academic and professional context. It covers the use of social media as well as tools for content creation, self-management, and self-development. Aspect such as digital well-being and online safety are also included.\nTo prepare course contents, refer to the Digital Competence Platform developed by the internet sociologist Anders Skov \u00a92016 Center for Digital Dannelse. This platform provides a lot of useful information and input for designing and implementing a course to foster digital competences. First, it provides an overview about the definition of digital competences. Moreover, methodological and theoretical consideration to map digital skills with the Digital Competence Wheel are presented. We suggest to use the Digital Competence Wheel to assess the competences of the participants before and after the course. Finally, four areas of digital competences are introduced (Skov, 2016):\n1. INFORMATION: identification, organization and analysis of digital information.\n2. COMMUNICATION: communication and interaction virtually.\n3. PRODUCTION: creation and editing of digital contents.\n4. SAFETY: consideration of rights and duties, strengths and risks, opportunities and threats when working with ICT. \nThese areas can serve as teaching blocks and a guide to structure the course, learning goals and content. We suggest a collaborative teaching and peer learning approach for this module.\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE:\nThis modules is designed to expose participants to a range of digital tools and topics that are useful for participants\u2019 personal and professional development as a student and as a professional. After an introduction to the program (see Unit 0), participants will be spending about 60 minutes each week to work through a number of tasks designed to encourage engagement with the tools and topics of that week, and to reflect on how they could be useful in their own context. New content, tasks and further information are released each week on a digital learning platform, and participants get an email reminder to complete the tasks, which they can do at their own pace and in their own time.\nEach module consists of a short introduction to the topic with pertinent information, a small selection of links to further information, and a set of tasks that require the learner to engage actively with the topic. \n\n\u2022 UNIT 0 \u2013 Kick off meeting and skills assessment (suggested format: live online seminar): The goal is to introduce the course, its learning objectives and structure including assessment types (if applicable) and to answer all questions of the participants before they start the asynchronous learning journey. The second part of the kick-off meeting will include the self-assessment of participants\u2019 digital competences using the Digital Competence Wheel.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 1 \u2013 Digital Project\no Exercise: Let your participants plan and implement their own blog, website or app (for advanced students), which they will operate over the whole period of the course (for 9 weeks). Each week they have to reflect on their learning creating a blog post, website entry or app feature. Let participants become creative and provide them with some ideas and inspiration, as well as useful (open source) software upfront:\n(1) Project Management, Process mapping, idea sketching and brainstorming: Trello, XMind\n(2) Blog/Website (no HTML skills necessary) for beginner level: Wix, Jimdo, Weebly\n(3) App (no programming skills necessary) for intermediate level or above: GoodBarber, Swiftic, AppYourself, Shoutem, Openasapp\n(4) App (free but programming skills necessary) for advanced level only: Visual Studio by Microsoft\n\n\u2022 UNIT 2 \u2013 Information\no Exercise: Let participant do a little research in the Internet about \u201cwhat are digital skills\u201d. Participants must store and organize this data and share it with one of their peers. The peer evaluates the relevance and purpose of the collected data and how it has been organized and stored. Different supporting tools are allowed and can be introduced, e.g. Citavi, Mendeley, Google Scholar, digital libraries (EBSCO, J-Store etc.), clouds (dropbox, wetransfer, etc.), formats (PDF, JPEG, etc.), other software and tools etc. before the exercise or after.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 3 - Communication\no Exercise: Participants will do a group work online about \u201cSocial Media and Communication\u201d and give an online presentation. The exercise is based on a peer evaluation according the following crucial criteria: online collaboration (type and interactivity), digital content (visualization, systems, applications), use of technology and media choice.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 4 \u2013 Digital Content Production\no Exercise: Participants will create a podcast, screencast, video or interactive images in groups. Tools and software programs can be introduced before the exercise to provide support (suggested for beginner level) or not, so that students can discover them in a self-paced manner (suggested for intermediate and higher level).\n\n\u2022 UNIT 5 \u2013 Safety (decide for one of the two exercises or the experiment)\no Exercise A: Participants follow the digital footprint of one of their peers and share what can be found on the internet about their peer.\no Experiment: Participants practice social media detox for one week and reflect on their experiences, drawing out positive and negative experiences, as well as opportunities and threats.\no Exercise B: Participants track their screen time for a week and see how many hours they spend online and what they do with this time. Afterwards, let them compare this with peers. In the end, let participants check the \u201cDigital Wellness\u201d functions of their devices and choose suitable settings for their own needs.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 6 \u2013 Artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and games (suggested for intermediate or higher proficiency level)\no Exercise: Give your participants the task to experiment with augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and games. They can work alone, in pairs, or in groups. They must share the experiences they have made (in any format they like, e.g. personal meeting and discussion, sharing a video or ppt) with at least one of their peers and compare their peers\u2019 experiences with their own experiences. Some examples are given here (let participants chose from the list or bring in their own ideas):\n(a) Go to the local consumer electronics store and try out virtual glasses! Sometimes also museums or other attractions use VR glasses, look at your local museum\u2019s homepage to find out more.\n(b) Observe your cleaning robot (or go to your friends who have one) and try to find out the underlying system, technology, and logic it cleans your home.\n(c) Try out a virtual reality game (or do some research about it). Have a look at the following Educatonal VR games (Tip: you can also try it out with your younger siblings or children).\n(d) Try out ChatGPT and do some research about this AI software developed by OpenAI (New York Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html)\nQuestions to answer for participants: \n(1) Is it a first time experience for you? What is it like? Did you enjoy it or not? Why?\n(2) Would you buy/use such a product/service? Why/why not?\n(3) Explain the underlying system, technologies and logics that are used!\n(4) Do some further research about the related risks and challenges!\n\n\u2022 UNIT 7 \u2013 Final Assessment\no Final Assignment: In order to obtain a certificate of completion, students have to complete all exercises and write a weekly blog post (website entry, app) (see Unit 1) where they submit the exercises and describe their learnings in the course.\n\n\u2022 EXTRA UNIT \u2013 Social networks (for intermediate or higher proficiency levels)\no Exercise A: Let participants look for a role model account that they like and follow on a social network (preferably: Twitter, Xing, LinkedIn). Participants have to draw out the strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats (let them do a SWOT analysis!) related to the chosen account and based on that analysis they should update their existing accounts. \no Exercise B (extension to Unit 5): Let participants read this New York Times Article Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout so Far (2018). There is also a documentary on Netflix: Cambridge Analyticas \u2013 The Great Hack.\n\n\n",

Tools and software programs can be introduced before the exercise to provide support (suggested for beginner level) or not, so that students can discover them in a self-paced manner (suggested for intermediate and higher level).\n\n\u2022 UNIT 5 \u2013 Safety (decide for one of the two exercises or the experiment)\no Exercise A: Participants follow the digital footprint of one of their peers and share what can be found on the internet about their peer.\no Experiment: Participants practice social media detox for one week and reflect on their experiences, drawing out positive and negative experiences, as well as opportunities and threats.\no Exercise B: Participants track their screen time for a week and see how many hours they spend online and what they do with this time. Afterwards, let them compare this with peers. In the end, let participants check the \u201cDigital Wellness\u201d functions of their devices and choose suitable settings for their own needs.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 6 \u2013 Artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and games (suggested for intermediate or higher proficiency level)\no Exercise: Give your participants the task to experiment with augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and games. They can work alone, in pairs, or in groups. They must share the experiences they have made (in any format they like, e.g. personal meeting and discussion, sharing a video or ppt) with at least one of their peers and compare their peers\u2019 experiences with their own experiences. Some examples are given here (let participants chose from the list or bring in their own ideas):\n(a) Go to the local consumer electronics store and try out virtual glasses! Sometimes also museums or other attractions use VR glasses, look at your local museum\u2019s homepage to find out more.\n(b) Observe your cleaning robot (or go to your friends who have one) and try to find out the underlying system, technology, and logic it cleans your home.\n(c) Try out a virtual reality game (or do some research about it). Have a look at the following Educatonal VR games (Tip: you can also try it out with your younger siblings or children).\n(d) Try out ChatGPT and do some research about this AI software developed by OpenAI (New York Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html)\nQuestions to answer for participants: \n(1) Is it a first time experience for you? What is it like? Did you enjoy it or not? Why?\n(2) Would you buy/use such a product/service? Why/why not?\n(3) Explain the underlying system, technologies and logics that are used!\n(4) Do some further research about the related risks and challenges!\n\n\u2022 UNIT 7 \u2013 Final Assessment\no Final Assignment: In order to obtain a certificate of completion, students have to complete all exercises and write a weekly blog post (website entry, app) (see Unit 1) where they submit the exercises and describe their learnings in the course.\n\n\u2022 EXTRA UNIT \u2013 Social networks (for intermediate or higher proficiency levels)\no Exercise A: Let participants look for a role model account that they like and follow on a social network (preferably: Twitter, Xing, LinkedIn). Participants have to draw out the strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats (let them do a SWOT analysis!) related to the chosen account and based on that analysis they should update their existing accounts. \no Exercise B (extension to Unit 5): Let participants read this New York Times Article Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout so Far (2018). There is also a documentary on Netflix: Cambridge Analyticas \u2013 The Great Hack.\n\n\n",

These digital certificates can be shared via social media and are used to validate acquired competences in front of potential employers or cli-ents. MCI developed the Digital Badge Program and offers a range of badges to MCI students (independently of graduation level and study program), who have collected experience and additional qualifications by engaging in extracurricular activities in dif-ferent ambits and fields. Thus, in addition to their regular studies, student enjoy the freedom to select badges according to their individual preferences, personal interests, and individual career plans to develop themselves further. In this way, students not only learn digital skills and become familiar with lifelong learning, but can also create a unique career portfolio (MCI, 2022).\n",

      "instructor_manual_": "INFORMATION & PREPARATION FOR THE EDUCATOR/TRAINER:\nThis module introduces a range of tools and topics relevant to digital skills development, with a focus on their application in participants\u2019 academic and professional context. It covers the use of social media as well as tools for content creation, self-management, and self-development. Aspect such as digital well-being and online safety are also included.\nTo prepare course contents, refer to the Digital Competence Platform developed by the internet sociologist Anders Skov \u00a92016 Center for Digital Dannelse. This platform provides a lot of useful information and input for designing and implementing a course to foster digital competences. First, it provides an overview about the definition of digital competences. Moreover, methodological and theoretical consideration to map digital skills with the Digital Competence Wheel are presented. We suggest to use the Digital Competence Wheel to assess the competences of the participants before and after the course. Finally, four areas of digital competences are introduced (Skov, 2016):\n1. INFORMATION: identification, organization and analysis of digital information.\n2. COMMUNICATION: communication and interaction virtually.\n3. PRODUCTION: creation and editing of digital contents.\n4. SAFETY: consideration of rights and duties, strengths and risks, opportunities and threats when working with ICT. \nThese areas can serve as teaching blocks and a guide to structure the course, learning goals and content. We suggest a collaborative teaching and peer learning approach for this module.\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE:\nThis modules is designed to expose participants to a range of digital tools and topics that are useful for participants\u2019 personal and professional development as a student and as a professional. After an introduction to the program (see Unit 0), participants will be spending about 60 minutes each week to work through a number of tasks designed to encourage engagement with the tools and topics of that week, and to reflect on how they could be useful in their own context. New content, tasks and further information are released each week on a digital learning platform, and participants get an email reminder to complete the tasks, which they can do at their own pace and in their own time.\nEach module consists of a short introduction to the topic with pertinent information, a small selection of links to further information, and a set of tasks that require the learner to engage actively with the topic. \n\n\u2022 UNIT 0 \u2013 Kick off meeting and skills assessment (suggested format: live online seminar): The goal is to introduce the course, its learning objectives and structure including assessment types (if applicable) and to answer all questions of the participants before they start the asynchronous learning journey. The second part of the kick-off meeting will include the self-assessment of participants\u2019 digital competences using the Digital Competence Wheel.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 1 \u2013 Digital Project\no Exercise: Let your participants plan and implement their own blog, website or app (for advanced students), which they will operate over the whole period of the course (for 9 weeks). Each week they have to reflect on their learning creating a blog post, website entry or app feature. Let participants become creative and provide them with some ideas and inspiration, as well as useful (open source) software upfront:\n(1) Project Management, Process mapping, idea sketching and brainstorming: Trello, XMind\n(2) Blog/Website (no HTML skills necessary) for beginner level: Wix, Jimdo, Weebly\n(3) App (no programming skills necessary) for intermediate level or above: GoodBarber, Swiftic, AppYourself, Shoutem, Openasapp\n(4) App (free but programming skills necessary) for advanced level only: Visual Studio by Microsoft\n\n\u2022 UNIT 2 \u2013 Information\no Exercise: Let participant do a little research in the Internet about \u201cwhat are digital skills\u201d. Participants must store and organize this data and share it with one of their peers. The peer evaluates the relevance and purpose of the collected data and how it has been organized and stored. Different supporting tools are allowed and can be introduced, e.g. Citavi, Mendeley, Google Scholar, digital libraries (EBSCO, J-Store etc.), clouds (dropbox, wetransfer, etc.), formats (PDF, JPEG, etc.), other software and tools etc. before the exercise or after.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 3 - Communication\no Exercise: Participants will do a group work online about \u201cSocial Media and Communication\u201d and give an online presentation. The exercise is based on a peer evaluation according the following crucial criteria: online collaboration (type and interactivity), digital content (visualization, systems, applications), use of technology and media choice.\n\n\u2022 UNIT 4 \u2013 Digital Content Production\no Exercise: Participants will create a podcast, screencast, video or interactive images in groups. Tools and software programs can be introduced before the exercise to provide support (suggested for beginner level) or not, so that students can discover them in a self-paced manner (suggested for intermediate and higher level).\n\n\u2022 UNIT 5 \u2013 Safety (decide for one of the two exercises or the experiment)\no Exercise A: Participants follow the digital footprint of one of their peers and share what can be found on the internet about their peer.\no Experiment: Participants practice social media detox for one week and reflect on their experiences, drawing out positive and negative experiences, as well as opportunities and threats.\no Exercise B: Participants track their screen time for a week and see how many hours they spend online and what they do with this time.

It\u2019s even more surprising that many people in the organization may not have a clear idea about their organization\u2019s strategic objectives. \n\nThis tool will help you and your leadership team align on the strategic objectives that are of the utmost importance for your organization- providing you with the directional guidance that you need to determine which innovation projects to accelerate and which of them to kill.\n\nDownload the Planning table and start to talk to your team:\n\nStep 1: Actions and Projects \u2013 As a team think about: What needs to be done to achieve those objectives? What concrete projects can you start? \nStep 2: Objectives and Priorities - How is your organisation going to reach the vision? What are the choices you made in your strategy and what are the objectives you set out for yourself? \nStep 3: Mission - What does your organisation want to achieve? What is your purpose and reason to wake up in the morning? \nStep 4: Vision - What does your organisation want to be? What is your organisation's ambition? \nStep 5: Values - What does your organisation stand for? What are your beliefs? \n\nWhen you answer the questions, be thoughtful about the milestones you want to achieve with your team and your organization as a whole. This step-by-step guide will help to align your strategic objectives with projects you should be pursuing\n",

It is also often referred as a minimum viable product (MVP).\n- A prototype should contain the essential features of a product that allow for idea testing. \n- A prototype does not need to be a perfect product. It is better to prioritize readiness to show the product/service to customers than a better finished product that would need larger investment.\n- A prototype can also validate the willingness of the user to pay for it (e.g., through a landing page).\n- Prototypes can be built iteratively, by progressively adding new features as long as new information is gathered from these tests.\n\nQuote for inspiration:\n\"If You're Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You\u2019ve Launched Too Late\" \n- Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn (cited in Saint, 2009)\n\n2- Quick brainstorming (20\u2019)\nThe participants are invited to group in teams of 3-4 people and design a new product or service. If the teams already are working on some project ideas, they can choose that project for prototyping. Otherwise, they can choose a topic by brainstorming several ideas quickly. \n\nSome inspirational inputs that the instructor can provide are:\n- Bike repair service\n- Kindergarden in the weekends\n- \u201cBabysitters that teach\u201d\n- The travel agency for the elder\n- City tours\n- Dog babysitting company\n- Personal trainer\n\n3- Design the offer (20\u2019)\nOnce every team has chosen the idea, they should design the offer. For that, they should: \n- Identify the need or problem they are trying to solve\n- Design the offer that solves this need\n\n4- Building the prototype (1h 30\u2019)\nThe instructor asks the participants to build a landing page as a prototype for the idea. The landing page usually serves to get the attention of the user and test how they perceive the offer. Landing pages usually incorporate a call to action for the user, such as providing the email to get more information, ordering the offer, making a preorder, downloading a free ebook or registering for an event. Landing pages are also useful to track the number of visitors and the actions they do using web site analytics.\n\nThe instructor can give the following instructions to the students:\n\n- Contents of the landing page:\n- Appealing title (and subtitle) that describes your offer or your benefit in a short sentence to get the users\u2019 attention\n- Features of the offer\n- Benefits for the user\n- Who you are (members of the entrepreneurial team)\n- Call to action to the user\n\n- Questions to identify the features of the offer that should be highlighted:\n- What are the essential features of the product/service?\n- What is your unique selling proposition?\n- What must be included to explain clearly what your product is about?\n\n- Design of the landing page:\n- The landing page should have a nice design, i.e., it should seem professional without much effort.  \n- A logo should be included, as well as appealing images that represent your business idea.\n- Tools:\n- To build the landing page, students can use wix\n- For free images: Unsplash, Pixabay, or Pexels.\n- To get inspiration for logos: fiverr, looka.\n\nAfter this introduction, the students are given 1h 15\u2019 to work on their prototypes.\n\n5- Feedback session (1h)\nIn this part of the session, every team needs to provide feedback to another team. All teams share the links to the landing pages. Then, the instructor randomly assigns to every team another team\u2019s landing page. \n\nFeedback can be structured along these lines:\n\n- Title and subtitle: do they capture the user\u2019s attention?\n- Are the features of that offer (unique selling point) clearly stated?\n- Design of the landing page: professional outlook, structure, clarity.\n- Logo design and suitability of the design to the offer.\n- What did you like most of the offer?\n- If you were a potential customer, would you be interested in that offer? Would you follow the call to action? Why? Why not?\n\nThe instructor gives 15\u2019 to each team to prepare the feedback. Then, every team shares the feedback aloud with the group. The instructor may add nuances and complementary points when needed.\n\nThe feedback session is relevant for learning, because every team has the opportunity to evaluate another team\u2019s work, learn from it, and provide useful comments. At the same time, teams receive other points of views on their work and can see how their proposal can be perceived by customers and other stakeholders.\n\n6- Wrap-Up (20\u2019)\n\nThe instructor asks the participants to reflect on the benefits of prototyping. A list of benefits highlighted by Voigt (2022) is:\n- See in real time how viable your product is\n- Understand potential go-to-market issues upfront, such as cost, time for development, or materials\n- Gather feedback from internal stakeholders and customers\n- Test out new ideas that may not be in the market currently \n- Get buy-in and support from investors and mentors\n\nFinally, the instructor asks every participant to reflect on the takeaways of the session:\n- What did I learn today?\n",

Design your new venture (40\u2019)\nThe participants need to design a new travel agency with an offer for young/adult people. The target group (youngsters/adults/artists/\u2026) should be the same as the participants to the session, since the participants will act both as entrepreneurs and potential customers.\n\nThe instructor introduces the setting for the activity:\n\na) Opportunity Recognition:\nYou are a team of young entrepreneurs that have observed:\n\u2022 Trips are life changing experiences\n\u2022 Young people (or chosen target group) are tired of \u201ctypical trips\u201d. They need something else.\n\u2022 Young people have little money. (you might change this observation depending on the target group)\n\u2022 Young people are adventurous. They are open to new experiences. (adapt to target group).\n\nb) Draft Idea:\nThus, you decided to build a new venture \u201cThe Trip of Your Life\u201d. \n\u2022 You are about to launch the new venture in three months.\n\u2022 And you\u2019ll like to test the idea with the target group.\n\nc) Design:\n\u2022 Quickly ideate & design the offer of your new venture.\n\u2022 Use the Business Model Canvas\n\nParticipants are organized into groups of 4-5. They are given 40\u2019 to design their idea and draft it in the Business Model Canvas.\n(Picture 1) Busines Model Canvas.\n\n2- Introduction to the scientific method (20\u2019)\nThe instructor asks the participants:\n\u2022 Was it easy to come with a good idea? Why? Why not?\n\u2022 Did you have several ideas? \n\u2022 How did you choose the best one(s)?\nThe purpose of this discussion is to make the participants reason about the uncertainty linked to a given venture. Even though they are designing a service for the target group where they also belong, there are many approaches, points of views and open possibilities in the process of design.\nNext, the instructor asks the participants how they would describe the business model canvas (BMC). \n\nAs follows, there is a list of potential definitions for Business Model that can be shared with the participants (Ovans, 2015):\n\n\u2022 \u201cHow you planned to make money\u201d -Michael Lewis (HBR)\n\u2022 \u201cA business model has two parts: \u201cPart one includes all the activities associated with making something: designing it, purchasing raw materials, manufacturing, and so on. Part two includes all the activities associated with selling something: finding and reaching customers, transacting a sale, distributing the product, or delivering the service. A new business model may turn on designing a new product for an unmet need or on a process innovation. -Joan Magretta\n\u2022 \u201cA set of assumptions or hypotheses\u201d - Alex Osterwalder. His nine-part \u201cbusiness model canvas\u201d is essentially an organized way to lay out your assumptions about not only the key resources and key activities of your value chain, but also your value proposition, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structures, and revenue streams \u2014 to see if you\u2019ve missed anything important and to compare your model to others.\n\u2022 \u201cAssumptions about what a company gets paid for\u201d \u2013 Peter Drucker (HBR)\n\nThe instructors listens to the answers and leads the discussion to the point of view of the BMC as a set of hypotheses that need to be tested. The instructor can relate this point of view to the uncertainties that the participants faced while they were designing their offer.\n\nThus, if the BMC can be seen as a set of assumptions that need to be tested, we can relate to the scientific method as a way of testing these assumptions:\n\u2022 Identifying hypothesis\n\u2022 Designing experiments\n\u2022 Running the tests\n\u2022 Gaining insights\n\nHerein, the instructor can explain the Design Loop and the Test Loop (see picture). In the Test Loop, we identify hypotheses, we design and run experiments and we learn from them. These learnings are then used in decision making: whether the idea needs to be adapted/refined/changed, discarded or kept. In the later case, the entrepreneurs might proceed with the next step of tests.\n \n##Picture1.3.5I.jpg##\n\n\n3- Let\u2019s become scientist entrepreneurs! Identify your hypotheses (20\u2019)\nNext, the instructor provides the next instructions for the participants:\n\u2022 Write down all the hypotheses that you can come up related to Customer, Value proposition, Revenue streams or other dimensions.\n\u2022 Prioritise and choose one or two hypotheses that you think you should test first.\n4- Let\u2019s become scientist entrepreneurs! Design your experiments (40\u2019)\nThe instructor asks the students to pick one hypotheses (maximum two) and design at least one experiment for each. Experiments need to be designed to provide answers to the stated hypotheses. Since this part of the exercise is run in the session, interviewing can be the most common and practical technique. However, the instructor can also encourage the participants to design other experiments beyond interviewing customers.\n\nFor the design of an experiment, the students are given the following instructions:\n\u2022 Decide how you will run the experiment (e.g., if interviews, prepare the interview)\n\u2022 Decide what you will measure.\n\u2022 Use the Test Card, designed by Strategizer (attached).\n \n##Picture2.3.5I.jpg##\n\n\n5- Run the experiments (30\u2019)\n\nThe participants are given 30\u2019 to run the experiments within the session. This would mean that the students might split in small teams of interviewers and reach as many potential customers as they can. The participants are invited to wander around the class and find potential customers who they might interview.\n\n5- Learn (30\u2019)\nThe students are invited to sit again with their teams and share the insights that they got during the interviews. Then, they are asked to synthetize their insights in the Learning Card:\n\u2022 Analyse the evidence gathered by the team.\n\u2022 Write down your learnings\n\u2022 Use the Learning Card, designed by Strategizer (fill in boxes \u201cWe believed that\u201d, \u201cWe observed\u201d, \u201cWe learned that\u201d\n\n\n \n##Picture3.3.5I.jpg##\n\n\n7- Decide (15\u2019)\nBased on the learnings, the students are invited to decide on the next steps for the offer:\n1. Persevere:\n\u2022  Continue testing the idea based on evidence and insights. You either test the same hypothesis and gather more evidence or you move to the next hypotheses\n2. Pivot:\n\u2022 The decision to make a significant change to one or more elements of your value proprosition.\n3. Kill:\n\u2022 Deciding to kill an idea based on evidence and insights. The evidence may have shown that an idea won\u2019t work in reality or that the profit potential is insuficient.\n\nParticipants take the Learning Card(s) and fill in box \u201cTherefore, we will...\u201d\n\n8- Group report (15\u2019)\nEvery group pitches for 3\u2019 the following steps:\n\u2022 Identified need\n\u2022 Original offer\n\u2022 Hypotheses selected to test\n\u2022 Design of the test\n\u2022 Insights\n\u2022 Decisions taken\n\n9- Meta-Learning & Learning Transfer (15\u2019)\nThe instructor asks the participants to reflect on the learnings of the session. These allows the students to gain a general understanding of what they did in the session and how they can apply the learnings to other ideas and projects that they are working on.\n\nTo guide thought, participants can use the Meta-Learning Card (attached).\n \n##Picture4.3.5I.jpg##\n\n\n\n",

Then, the participants are asked to choose a service that they would like to create, and then draw the co-creation process that would lead to the design of that service. \nThe participants will practice the implementation of the co-creation process on the service selected, ideally by inviting stakeholders (including customers or users) to participate as active members of the co-creation process. If this is not feasible, then the participants can roleplay some of the stakeholders.\n\n1.1. Introduction to Co-creation\n\nThe facilitator introduces the concept of co-creation and co-design and its main differences from the well-known design thinking approach.\n\nSanders and Stappers provide a definition for the terms co-creation and co-design:\nThe authors take co-creation to refer to any act of collective creativity, i.e. creativity that is shared by two or more people. Co-creation is a very broad term with applications ranging from the physical to the metaphysical and from the material to the spiritual, as can be seen by the output of search engines. By co-design we indicate collective creativity as it is applied across the whole span of a design process, as was intended by the name of this journal. Thus, co-design is a specific instance of co-creation. Co-design refers, for some people, to the collective creativity of collaborating designers. We use co-design in a broader sense to refer to the creativity of designers and people not trained in design working together in the design development process (Sanders&Stappers, 2008, p.3).\nIn this module, we apply the principles of collective creation of a service by designers and non-designers and thus, we might be closer to the term co-design. In any case, in the last decades, the creation of products and services has been shifted from a product-centric view to personalised consumer experiences. As quoted in Sanders & Stappers (2008), \u201cinformed, networked, empowered and active consumers are increasingly co-creating value with the firm\u201d. \n\nIn the classical approach of design thinking, the designers investigate the user\u2019s experience, and then design products and services that respond to the observed needs. In co-creation, the users and other stakeholders take part of the design process themselves. The consumers not only report on their experiences but also design the solution together with the rest of the team.\n  \n##picture3.5A_1##\nFigure 1. Classical and co-design approaches to design (Sanders&Stappers, 2008, p.11)\n\n1.2. Choose a service\nThe participants are invited to choose a problem or domain where a service could be designed or improved. It is important that this service is within the hands of the team and that they can identify potential stakeholders who can take part of the process. If the service is something that is relevant to the organisation or university, the participants will find it more motivating and accessible. Examples of problems can be:\n\u2022 Redesign the bar/cantine of the university/organisation\n\u2022 Redesign the reception service of the university/organisation\n\u2022 Design an app to inform the users (e.g., timetables, events held at the university/organisation\u2026)\n\u2022 Improve the student\u2019s experience related to exams\n\u2022 Improve the communication between departments\n\nOther examples that would go beyond the existing environment of the university/organisation could be thought of. In such cases, the co-creation processes could be held by using a challenge suggested by a company or organisation and the co-creation process could be organised as a bootcamp, with participation of the different stakeholders. Some typical examples would be designing apps for health applications.\n\u2022 Design an app to help people reduce alcohol consumption \n\u2022 Design an app to help reduce smoking\n\n1.3. Design the Co-creation process\nOnce the topic is decided, the participants need to design the co-creation process in detail. The design will be reviewed by the facilitator who will provide feedback.\n\nCore-team:\n\u2022 Identify the members of the core team. The core co-creation team are the participants of the team that promote the design of the service.\n\u2022 Each member of the core team can take a different role or changing roles along the process. Some of the roles are: project leader, documentation, relations with stakeholders, resources responsible, etc.\n\u2022 Decide how you will organise the role of each member and the associated tasks.\n\nStakeholders:\n1. Identify the stakeholders: identify the customers, users, and the stakeholders that are related to the service. This might include current service providers, experts, developers, etc. For example, in the design of a health application, stakeholders could include the patients, the patients\u2019 relatives, doctors, medical personnel, pharmaceutical companies, application designers, developers, etc.\n2. Think how you will reach these stakeholders, e.g., by email, through social networks, by direct call, through your network, etc. Organise the task of onboarding stakeholders among the team members.\n3. Prepare a short slidedoc to inform your stakeholders about the goal of the co-creation session and the value that they are expected to provide.\n\nOutline of the sessions:\nPrepare the outline of the sessions of co-creation:\n\u2022 Session 1: In the first session, the participants contribute by reflecting on current issues of related services, needs or difficulties they are facing related to the service (or lack of service). After the session, the core team of designers (the team of participants of the course) prepares a summary and shares it with the co-creation team.\n\u2022 Session 2: the co-creation team reviews the conclusions of the first session and design a service (or an improved service) that resonates with the customers/users. The results of the session is the design of the service. After the session, the core team of designers refines the design according to the contribution of the stakeholders. If there are compromising views, the core team takes decisions.\n\u2022 Session 3: the core team presents the final design of the service and designs a set of activities to test the design with the stakeholders and get feedback from them. A refined service is finally devised by the core team and the service would be ready.\n\nEvery team needs to prepare the outline for each session. The sessions should be prepared attending to the goals for every session. At this stage, the team prepares a detailed outline for session 1 and a preliminary outline for sessions 2 and 3, which could be later revised and updated according to the results and the experience gathered in previous sessions. See the instructions provided in the next sections to get an idea of the session structure and contents.\n\nPlan the resources:\n\u2022 List the resources that you need to run every of the sessions. Decide who will take care of this issue among the members of the core team.\n\nPlan the process:\n\u2022 The facilitator will provide details on how to implement the three co-creation sessions with the stakeholders. The ideal scenario is that every team has a facilitator that helps run the co-creation session. Every team could be located in a different room so that there are no interferences among the teams. \n\u2022 In the case that \u201creal stakeholders\u201d can\u2019t attend the sessions, then, some participants can roleplay those stakeholders. For that, the team should be large enough to allow for several profiles in the co-creation session. Every actor should prepare its point of view related to the topic. This can be done by observing the behaviour of that profile or getting information from them (e.g., interviews, desk research, etc.).\n\u2022 List the major tasks of the co-creation process, set the deadlines and the responsible persons for each deliverable.\n\n1.4.  Presentations and conclusions\nEvery team should present the co-creation design to the assigned facilitator to get feedback. In fact, the facilitator can be part of the co-creation team and thus, she guides and helps the participants along the required tasks of this session. The session ends with a final presentation of every team, with the problem domain identified, the stakeholders and a brief summary of the design of the three sessions.\n\n\u2026\u2026..\n\nSESSION 2- Co-creation session 1 - Problem identification\nThe fist session of the co-creation process is the most relevant one, since it sets the context for trust among the participants, which is crucial to the contribution of every stakeholder to the co-creation team. The ambience of trust needs to be generated by the core team who needs to set the conditions for collaboration and contribution.\n\nThe outline for this session could be:\n1. Introduction of the core team\n2. Purpose of the project (what service is going to be designed or redesigned).\n3. Goal of the first session\n4. Rules for contribution\n5. Who is in the session (stakeholders invited)\n6. Warm-up and introduction of the stakeholders\n7. Brainstorming of needs, problems, difficulties related to the service according to the perspective of every stakeholders.\n8. Sharing results of the brainstorming\n9. Synthetizing the results of the brainstorming.\n10. Next commitments\n\nBefore conducting the session, decide who in the core team is in charge of introducing every phase of the session.\nThe rules for contributing to the session and the remaining sessions of the co-creation process are:\n\u2022 There are no hierarchies (such as patient-doctor, student-professor). \n\u2022 All stakeholders have the same relevance and should provide their own point of view.\n\u2022 All stakeholders provide a valuable experience or point of view.\n\u2022 There are no correct or incorrect answers or opinions.\n\u2022 There is no need to edit or correct another\u2019s opinion. All opinions are valuable and will be gathered.\n\u2022 The values for the sessions are: humility, respect for others, communication, collaboration, \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid of asking\u201d\nFor step 7, it would be nice to group the different stakeholders in teams and allow them brainstorm the problems and difficulties that they find from their own experience. To prevent some opinions dominate or bias others, brainwriting is a better option than a regular brainstorming.\nAs for the \u201cNext commitments\u201d, the core team can provide a metaphor that gives an enhanced meaning to their endeavour (e.g., the team as a boat that navigates to their destiny) and invites all the stakeholders to commit to the next sessions.\nAfter the session, the core team synthesizes the results and sends a slidedoc to all the stakeholders with the main insights. The insights should be grouped in different areas. For example, when designing a better service, some clusters of problems could be: a) opening hours, b) communication with the waiters, c) quality and diversity of food, d) food and drink experience, etc.\n----\nSESSION 3- Co-creation session 2 \u2013 Co-Design\nThe session starts by reviewing the results of the previous session and setting the goal for the current session, which is co-designing the service. As follows, there is an outline for the session:\n1. Welcoming the participants.\n2. Wrap up of previous session: presenting the results of the session and the problems identified in several clusters.\n3. Ice breaker activity with participation of every member of the co-creation team.\n4. Brainstorming solutions for each cluster (as before, brainwriting can be a better alternative).\n5. Sharing the solutions\n6. Organising the different solutions in different categories for each cluster\n7. Voting and selection of the best solutions\n8. Final conclusions & next steps\n9. Next commitments (reference to the metaphor \u201cthe boat is sailing with favourable winds\u201d).\nAfter the session, the core team summarises the output of the session and sends a document with the main conclusions to the whole co-creation team.\nSESSION 4- Co-creation session 3- Validation\nThe goal of this session is to allow the co-creation team to validate the service design. For that, the core team presents a prototype collecting the main ideas of the service and the co-creation team validates the service through a series of activities.\n\nThe prototype of the service in a number of ways:\n- Design of an application (using a sotware such as Figma, or using drawings in a paper)\n- Service design depicted in different visuals, among them, storyboards showing the customer experience.\n- Roleplay with a drafted scenario.\n- Landing page (see 3.5. Design Validation\u201d \u2013 Advanced)\n\nThe core team has also prepared a series of activities that the remaining co-creation team should run in order to validate the service. Depending on the service design, and the prototype that is built, the team can be challenged to conduct tests to see whether the service is adequate and responds to the identified problems and needs. For example, if the team is designing a new bar service, the participants are challenged to perform tasks:\n- Go to the bar at 7pm and it is closed. How can you know the opening hours? How can you get your drink if it is closed?\n- Look at the menu and choose a veggie menu.\n\nThe team can evaluate the quality of the service by filling in a form or template, so that feedback is gathered systematically.\n\nIt is important to conclude the session and thank the participants for their effort and contribution. The metaphor is used again and every participant of the co-creation team can get a small gift for their contribution to the co-creation process. The gift can be connected to the metaphor or the work done during the sessions.\n\nAfter the session, the core team summarises the insights of the session and sends an executive summary to the co-creation team with the insights of the whole process. It is good that the document contains the next steps that will be taken to develop or further test the service.\n\nSESSION 5- Insights and conclusions\nIn the final session, all the teams present their projects, by detailing the process followed, the final service and learnings and takeaways from the experience. \nThe facilitator asks the participants to reflect on meta-learnings of this experience:\n- What are the benefits of co-creation?\n- What are the differences between co-creation and design thinking?\n- Did you obtain insights and results that wouldn\u2019t have been identified with other methods?\n- What were the most difficult tasks of the process?\n- How did you build trust among the participants?\n- How did the participants contribute to the process?\n- What difficulties did you face?\n- What would you make differently if you did it again?\n",

Alternatively, also innovative and sustainable ideas with an impact for the company/organization may be fostered.\n\nProcedure:\nNote: for the basic proficiency level we suggest skipping the call for ideas (#1) and the mentoring (#3), but focus on an idea pitch (#2) in front of experts/entrepreneurs only.\n1. Call for Ideas: Two times a year, Talented Youngsters / High Potential submit a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) with an idea that generates economic, ecological, and social impact for the region (first deadline by the end of the winter term, e.g. January, second deadline by the end of the summer term, e.g. July). \n2. Idea Pitch: Two times a year, during the Idea Pitch Day, a max of 4 Talented Youngsters / High Potentials are selected (based on the submitted factsheets) to pitch in front of a panel of experienced entrepreneurs from the region / experts of the respective fields (e.g., 5 to 10 entrepreneurs/experts).\nIdea Pitch Day:\no Welcome & Introduction of program, participants, entrepreneurs/experts\no Idea Pitch of a max. of 4 ideas (15 minutes time per pitch)\no Evaluation of pitches and ideas by entrepreneurs/experts in camera (1 hour), selection of the winning idea and selection of mentor candidates. The entrepreneurs/experts decide, which idea they are most interested in and which idea they would be willing to support and which Talented Youngster they would like to mentor over half a year. It may be that they all want to support and accompany the same idea and only one Talented Youngster. This is a strategic decision (although it might be emotionally driven too) and depends on the field of expertise, on the individual chemistry between mentor and mentee, and on the conviction that the mentor can contribute, but will get something in return too.\no Mentor Matching: Those mentors, who decide to support a Talented Youngster and his/her idea, stand up and offer their help, giving a short promotional speech why they would like to help and why they are the right choice of a mentor. The Talented Youngster decides by whom he/she would like to be mentored. If the Talented Youngster finds a mentor, the matching is successful and both will proceed to the awarding ceremony. Each Talented Youngster can only decide for one mentor, although several offers may have been made, unless mentors do not decide to cooperate (entrepreneurs may decide to bundle their competences and support an idea as a team). It may be that all four Talented Youngsters get an offer; it may be that none of the candidates gets an offer. The matching should ideally bring together a young start-upper and a successful entrepreneur, but also for example an enthusiastic young intrapreneur with a leader/manger/CEO or a young professional with an expert of the field.\no Awarding Ceremony: if a matching between Talented Youngster and Experienced Entrepreneur takes place, these two proceed to the awarding ceremony. If possible, the entrepreneur/expert offers also monetary start-up aid to support the idea, but above all, the entrepreneur agrees to act as a role model and mentor for the youngster, sharing feedback, insights and network for a period of six months.\n3. Mentoring: Learning together is better \u2013 The Talented Youngsters document their journey (e.g. in a diary, blog) with the experienced entrepreneur/expert throughout six months. They meet every month at least once (digital or in person). The mentoring process is coordinated and pre-structured by the instructor/facilitator. Documentation (e.g. diary keeping, blog) must be provided for each meeting:\n\nMentoring Process\nMonth Milestones Description Documentation\nMonth 1 1. Familiarization Get to know each other: the entrepreneur introduces the Youngster to his/her spheres of action. The Youngster again explains his/her intentions. Common goals are defined. Photo of the first meeting and outline of common goals in written form.\nMonth 2 2. Polishing idea Idea is presented again and entrepreneur gives critical feedback and suggestions for improvement. Written reflection about feedback by Talented Youngster.\nMonth 3 3. Network Introduction into the network of the entrepreneur, establishing contacts and building up a network. Proof of contacting a min. of 5 relevant stakeholders (e.g. email correspondence, photo, etc.).\nMonth 4 4. Prototyping and Interim Presentation Pilot phase and pre-implementation phase of idea. Documentation of the prototyping phase via Screencast, created jointly by Youngster and entrepreneur.\nMonth 5 5. Mentoring This milestone refers to the lessons learned during the mentoring, in particular inspiration and benefits that the entrepreneur can take away from the mentoring. Of course, also challenges and negative reflections should be shared. Written reflection about mentoring process and mentoring experience. \nMonth 6 6. Idea Realization This is the ideal case but not a must. Try to evaluate if the intended goals have been reached or explain why they could have not been reached and how to reach them in the future. Give an outlook for the future (e.g. is the idea worth to be pursued in future? Development opportunities\u2026). Two final reports, one by the Youngster and one by the entrepreneur.\n\nPreparation for Instructors/Facilitators:\n1. Connect with entrepreneurs / experts from the region and try to convince them for the program. This is not a must, but it will be much easier if you have allies and is much more in scope of the program as it renders the program more effective in terms of developing and fostering the competence learning through experience and making a regional impact.\n2. Try to activate your partners and network in the region and let them sign a memorandum of understanding to participate in the program as mentors for six months. These mentors act as enabler, start-up support, idea polishers, role model, inspirers, experts and evaluators. Do not forget to point out the value added for participating in this program as mentors (example below). At the same time, try to convince them to give start up aids and provide monetary support to those ideas/talents that they are especially interested in. Alternatively, you may choose internal candidates from your own organisation to take part in the program.\nBenefits for entrepreneurs/experts:\no Access to and active shaping of innovative ideas with added value for the region.\no Setting the course for the regional economy and innovativeness.\no Network expansion.\no Exchanging ideas with young motivated people and forming the next generation of entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs in the region/organization.\no Collecting mentoring experience and considering it for human resource development or customer relationship management.\no PR & image cultivation.\n3. Try to identify talented youngsters in your area in terms of high potentials. You may have internal processes/programs, which will guide you in doing so. If not you may start an open call for submissions of ideas where everybody can submit ideas (every employee of an organisation / every student at the university) or only a selected pool of people (only employees from the department/working group XY / students belonging to the faculty of social sciences).\n4. Prepare a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) that must be filled in in order to submit an idea. We recommend a digital process, e.g. online form.\n5. Prepare a standardized mentoring process.\n",

Call for Ideas: Two times a year, Talented Youngsters / High Potential submit a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) with an idea that generates economic, ecological, and social impact for the region (first deadline by the end of the winter term, e.g. January, second deadline by the end of the summer term, e.g. July). \n2. Idea Pitch: Two times a year, during the Idea Pitch Day, a max of 4 Talented Youngsters / High Potentials are selected (based on the submitted factsheets) to pitch in front of a panel of experienced entrepreneurs from the region / experts of the respective fields (e.g., 5 to 10 entrepreneurs/experts).\nIdea Pitch Day:\no Welcome & Introduction of program, participants, entrepreneurs/experts\no Idea Pitch of a max. of 4 ideas (15 minutes time per pitch)\no Evaluation of pitches and ideas by entrepreneurs/experts in camera (1 hour), selection of the winning idea and selection of mentor candidates. The entrepreneurs/experts decide, which idea they are most interested in and which idea they would be willing to support and which Talented Youngster they would like to mentor over half a year. It may be that they all want to support and accompany the same idea and only one Talented Youngster. This is a strategic decision (although it might be emotionally driven too) and depends on the field of expertise, on the individual chemistry between mentor and mentee, and on the conviction that the mentor can contribute, but will get something in return too.\no Mentor Matching: Those mentors, who decide to support a Talented Youngster and his/her idea, stand up and offer their help, giving a short promotional speech why they would like to help and why they are the right choice of a mentor. The Talented Youngster decides by whom he/she would like to be mentored. If the Talented Youngster finds a mentor, the matching is successful and both will proceed to the awarding ceremony. Each Talented Youngster can only decide for one mentor, although several offers may have been made, unless mentors do not decide to cooperate (entrepreneurs may decide to bundle their competences and support an idea as a team). It may be that all four Talented Youngsters get an offer; it may be that none of the candidates gets an offer. The matching should ideally bring together a young start-upper and a successful entrepreneur, but also for example an enthusiastic young intrapreneur with a leader/manger/CEO or a young professional with an expert of the field.\no Awarding Ceremony: if a matching between Talented Youngster and Experienced Entrepreneur takes place, these two proceed to the awarding ceremony. If possible, the entrepreneur/expert offers also monetary start-up aid to support the idea, but above all, the entrepreneur agrees to act as a role model and mentor for the youngster, sharing feedback, insights and network for a period of six months.\n3. Mentoring: Learning together is better \u2013 The Talented Youngsters document their journey (e.g. in a diary, blog) with the experienced entrepreneur/expert throughout six months. They meet every month at least once (digital or in person). The mentoring process is coordinated and pre-structured by the instructor/facilitator. Documentation (e.g. diary keeping, blog) must be provided for each meeting:\n\nMentoring Process\nMonth Milestones Description Documentation\nMonth 1 1. Familiarization Get to know each other: the entrepreneur introduces the Youngster to his/her spheres of action. The Youngster again explains his/her intentions. Common goals are defined. Photo of the first meeting and outline of common goals in written form.\nMonth 2 2. Polishing idea Idea is presented again and entrepreneur gives critical feedback and suggestions for improvement. Written reflection about feedback by Talented Youngster.\nMonth 3 3. Network Introduction into the network of the entrepreneur, establishing contacts and building up a network. Proof of contacting a min. of 5 relevant stakeholders (e.g. email correspondence, photo, etc.).\nMonth 4 4. Prototyping and Interim Presentation Pilot phase and pre-implementation phase of idea. Documentation of the prototyping phase via Screencast, created jointly by Youngster and entrepreneur.\nMonth 5 5. Mentoring This milestone refers to the lessons learned during the mentoring, in particular inspiration and benefits that the entrepreneur can take away from the mentoring. Of course, also challenges and negative reflections should be shared. Written reflection about mentoring process and mentoring experience. \nMonth 6 6. Idea Realization This is the ideal case but not a must. Try to evaluate if the intended goals have been reached or explain why they could have not been reached and how to reach them in the future. Give an outlook for the future (e.g. is the idea worth to be pursued in future? Development opportunities\u2026). Two final reports, one by the Youngster and one by the entrepreneur.\n\nPreparation for Instructors/Facilitators:\n1. Connect with entrepreneurs / experts from the region and try to convince them for the program. This is not a must, but it will be much easier if you have allies and is much more in scope of the program as it renders the program more effective in terms of developing and fostering the competence learning through experience and making a regional impact.\n2. Try to activate your partners and network in the region and let them sign a memorandum of understanding to participate in the program as mentors for six months. These mentors act as enabler, start-up support, idea polishers, role model, inspirers, experts and evaluators. Do not forget to point out the value added for participating in this program as mentors (example below). At the same time, try to convince them to give start up aids and provide monetary support to those ideas/talents that they are especially interested in. Alternatively, you may choose internal candidates from your own organisation to take part in the program.\nBenefits for entrepreneurs/experts:\no Access to and active shaping of innovative ideas with added value for the region.\no Setting the course for the regional economy and innovativeness.\no Network expansion.\no Exchanging ideas with young motivated people and forming the next generation of entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs in the region/organization.\no Collecting mentoring experience and considering it for human resource development or customer relationship management.\no PR & image cultivation.\n3. Try to identify talented youngsters in your area in terms of high potentials. You may have internal processes/programs, which will guide you in doing so. If not you may start an open call for submissions of ideas where everybody can submit ideas (every employee of an organisation / every student at the university) or only a selected pool of people (only employees from the department/working group XY / students belonging to the faculty of social sciences).\n4. Prepare a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) that must be filled in in order to submit an idea. We recommend a digital process, e.g. online form.\n5. Prepare a standardized mentoring process.\n",
