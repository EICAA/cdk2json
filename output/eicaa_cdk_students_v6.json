If you are wondering what an innovation actually is, then first of all just let your everyday understanding guide you and assume that the word part \u2018nova\u2019 (=new) in innovation is important.\nDay 2 \u2013 Failures are educational: Identifying successful innovations is a comparatively easy exercise, as you have already seen. A somewhat greater challenge is to remember your own failures or the flops of others. One\u2019s own failures are often banned from our active memory by repression mechanisms. However, this is not very helpful. It is a truism that you learn from mistakes. What may be new to you is that, scientifically proven, one some-times learns more from the mistakes of others than from one\u2019s own mistakes.\nDay 3 \u2013 Creative destruction: Creative or creational destruction describes the phenomenon of the new displacing the old. New technologies displace old technologies. New products displace old products. New companies displace old companies.\nDay 4 \u2013 Non-customer potential: You can learn and be inspired from this group of non-customers. Maybe these non-customers are presented from buying your products by certain barriers. Maybe these non-customers do not need your products because they have other means to solve the problems your product solves. Another reason could be that these non-customers do not value the benefits that your product \u2013 by which we mean goods and services \u2013 provides. By knowing the obstacles and barriers of your non-customers, you can derive innovation opportunities.\u00a0\nDay 5 \u2013 Without exaggeration: The German economies owe a large part of their success, as they say, to the technical precision that characterizes many innovations. However, these masterpieces of engineering are disadvantageous for economic reasons if, firstly, customers do not or cannot appreciate this precision, or if, secondly, this precision manifests itself in a multitude of functions that are only used by a small number of customers.\nDay 6 \u2013 Arrrrrgh: The world would probably be (almost) perfect if all products worked the way the respective innovators imagined. Unfortunately \u2013 or perhaps thankfully \u2013, the world is not quite so perfect. This allows you to improve products continuously. Observe your customers interacting with your products.\nDay 7 \u2013 Future: Innovation always means dealing with the future. Innovation is not about generating sales and success with current activities. Rather, it is about laying the foundation for success in the future with today\u2019s activities. That\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful \u2013 and that\u2019s probably a clear understatement \u2013 to get involved with the future and try to figure out what the future might look like.\nDay 8 \u2013 The last day: Now it\u2019s time to reflect on these inspirations and ideas and put them into action. For the presentation and eventually as an orientation for the implementation of an idea, you need a structure. The Business Model Canvas presented by Osterwalter and Pigneur (2010) provides a good structure with which innovations can also be represented well, since the questions posed by Osterwalder and Pigneur explain very well what is behind an idea.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "https://www.innov8-now.org/en/innov8-now-program/\n\nOsterwalder, A., & Pigneur, Y.

If you are wondering what an innovation actually is, then first of all just let your everyday understanding guide you and assume that the word part \u2018nova\u2019 (=new) in innovation is important.\nDay 2 \u2013 Failures are educational: Identifying successful innovations is a comparatively easy exercise, as you have already seen. A somewhat greater challenge is to remember your own failures or the flops of others. One\u2019s own failures are often banned from our active memory by repression mechanisms. However, this is not very helpful. It is a truism that you learn from mistakes. What may be new to you is that, scientifically proven, one some-times learns more from the mistakes of others than from one\u2019s own mistakes.\nDay 3 \u2013 Creative destruction: Creative or creational destruction describes the phenomenon of the new displacing the old. New technologies displace old technologies. New products displace old products. New companies displace old companies.\nDay 4 \u2013 Non-customer potential: You can learn and be inspired from this group of non-customers. Maybe these non-customers are presented from buying your products by certain barriers. Maybe these non-customers do not need your products because they have other means to solve the problems your product solves. Another reason could be that these non-customers do not value the benefits that your product \u2013 by which we mean goods and services \u2013 provides. By knowing the obstacles and barriers of your non-customers, you can derive innovation opportunities.\u00a0\nDay 5 \u2013 Without exaggeration: The German economies owe a large part of their success, as they say, to the technical precision that characterizes many innovations. However, these masterpieces of engineering are disadvantageous for economic reasons if, firstly, customers do not or cannot appreciate this precision, or if, secondly, this precision manifests itself in a multitude of functions that are only used by a small number of customers.\nDay 6 \u2013 Arrrrrgh: The world would probably be (almost) perfect if all products worked the way the respective innovators imagined. Unfortunately \u2013 or perhaps thankfully \u2013, the world is not quite so perfect. This allows you to improve products continuously. Observe your customers interacting with your products.\nDay 7 \u2013 Future: Innovation always means dealing with the future. Innovation is not about generating sales and success with current activities. Rather, it is about laying the foundation for success in the future with today\u2019s activities. That\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful \u2013 and that\u2019s probably a clear understatement \u2013 to get involved with the future and try to figure out what the future might look like.\nDay 8 \u2013 The last day: Now it\u2019s time to reflect on these inspirations and ideas and put them into action. For the presentation and eventually as an orientation for the implementation of an idea, you need a structure. The Business Model Canvas presented by Osterwalter and Pigneur (2010) provides a good structure with which innovations can also be represented well, since the questions posed by Osterwalder and Pigneur explain very well what is behind an idea.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "https://www.innov8-now.org/en/innov8-now-program/\n\nOsterwalder, A., & Pigneur, Y.

If you are wondering what an innovation actually is, then first of all just let your everyday understanding guide you and assume that the word part \u2018nova\u2019 (=new) in innovation is important.\nDay 2 \u2013 Failures are educational: Identifying successful innovations is a comparatively easy exercise, as you have already seen. A somewhat greater challenge is to remember your own failures or the flops of others. One\u2019s own failures are often banned from our active memory by repression mechanisms. However, this is not very helpful. It is a truism that you learn from mistakes. What may be new to you is that, scientifically proven, one some-times learns more from the mistakes of others than from one\u2019s own mistakes.\nDay 3 \u2013 Creative destruction: Creative or creational destruction describes the phenomenon of the new displacing the old. New technologies displace old technologies. New products displace old products. New companies displace old companies.\nDay 4 \u2013 Non-customer potential: You can learn and be inspired from this group of non-customers. Maybe these non-customers are presented from buying your products by certain barriers. Maybe these non-customers do not need your products because they have other means to solve the problems your product solves. Another reason could be that these non-customers do not value the benefits that your product \u2013 by which we mean goods and services \u2013 provides. By knowing the obstacles and barriers of your non-customers, you can derive innovation opportunities.\u00a0\nDay 5 \u2013 Without exaggeration: The German economies owe a large part of their success, as they say, to the technical precision that characterizes many innovations. However, these masterpieces of engineering are disadvantageous for economic reasons if, firstly, customers do not or cannot appreciate this precision, or if, secondly, this precision manifests itself in a multitude of functions that are only used by a small number of customers.\nDay 6 \u2013 Arrrrrgh: The world would probably be (almost) perfect if all products worked the way the respective innovators imagined. Unfortunately \u2013 or perhaps thankfully \u2013, the world is not quite so perfect. This allows you to improve products continuously. Observe your customers interacting with your products.\nDay 7 \u2013 Future: Innovation always means dealing with the future. Innovation is not about generating sales and success with current activities. Rather, it is about laying the foundation for success in the future with today\u2019s activities. That\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful \u2013 and that\u2019s probably a clear understatement \u2013 to get involved with the future and try to figure out what the future might look like.\nDay 8 \u2013 The last day: Now it\u2019s time to reflect on these inspirations and ideas and put them into action. For the presentation and eventually as an orientation for the implementation of an idea, you need a structure. The Business Model Canvas presented by Osterwalter and Pigneur (2010) provides a good structure with which innovations can also be represented well, since the questions posed by Osterwalder and Pigneur explain very well what is behind an idea.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "https://www.innov8-now.org/en/innov8-now-program/\n\nOsterwalder, A., & Pigneur, Y.

In entrepreneurship, originality comes from creating value for the customer/user, for the organization and/or for the society at large. In entrepreneurship, opportunity arises when there are unsolved problems (or unsatisfied needs) or when the existing solutions can be improved. This might imply not only the design of a new product or service, but a wider range of types of solutions, such as a new relationship with the customer, a new business model, improved processes in a company, etc.\n\nThus, we assume that the original idea is inspired by a problem or need of users, organizations and/or society. Consequently, the first step in the creative process is to understand in deep the problem or need. The opportunity is a problem not solved (or an unsatisfied need) or a problem /need that can be solved better by means of a new technology or a new business approach.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe creative process goes from the problem to the opportunity based on a synthesis process where the client's insights are related to the technological and business possibilities. It is about converting a latent need into an explicit need (a well-posed problem).\u00a0\n\nThe creative method in this level is divided in 4 steps:\u00a0\u00a01) Framing the problem,\u00a0\u00a02) Ideation, 3) Selection of ideas, 4) value proposition.\n\nPROCESS\nThe creative process requires freedom as well as a certain discipline. The desired output is to create a concept that is attractive to the user, as well as viable for the organization and feasible to carry out. The creative process is not linear, and may require several iterations. In this sense, a visual support (e.g., visual map) is helpful to guide the process.\n\nStep 1: Framing the Problem\n\nThe aim is to contextualize the problem through a basic research. The team analyzes the information and data about the problem and tries to imagine the needs of the potential customer. This first knowledge about the problem, in form of customer insights, will drive the ideation process.\n\nTo conduct this step, the facilitator asks the participants to identify a given problem (e.g., fostering public transportation in a big city, reducing waste, fostering healthy habits in children\u2026). Then, the team gather information about the problem and draw the main needs or problems associated to the chosen problem.\n\nStep 2: Ideation Process\nBased on the chosen insights, an idea generation session is prepared. First, the facilitator introduces the rules that will be applied for the creativity session: do not criticize, do not play, do not edit the ideas, build on the ideas of others, focus on quantity not quality. Every idea is written in sticky notes and included in the visual map or poster.\u00a0\n\nThe participants are asked to generate as many ideas as possible, since the focus of this stage is quantity, not quality. Every idea needs to be associated to one of the insights identified in the previous step. Thus, every insight needs to be associated to many ideas. The mural is used to place the generated ideas. The mural can be digital (if the session if held online) or a large paper (for face to face sessions).\n\nBefore starting, the facilitator can hold a warm-up session (for example, from reviewing the brief, stretching the body, or another ice-breaking exercise).\u00a0\n\nStep 3: Selection of the Ideas\nAfter the generation of ideas, the team selects or combines these large ideas into a reduced set, by focusing on the creation of value. To do this, the team first analyzes the mural. By looking for patterns and repetitions, ideas are grouped. Once this is done, the team defines the criteria for selecting the ideas. With these criteria, the main ideas are prioritized. In the mural this action corresponds to moving the key ideas to the right area of the mural and highlighting them.\n\n##pictures/1.3::pictureB1.png##\n\n\n4. Writing the Value Preposition\nThe value proposition is a call to action about the benefit(s) that the idea brings to the user. This is phased in a statement such as:\nWe help \u2026 [User] to \u2026 [Benefit] by doing .. [Solution]\n\nThe value proposition should be brief, concise and impressive. To do this, the statement includes the customer archetype (user), the benefit (need or problem to solve), and finally the solution, which is a way of grouping the main ideas that have been determined.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "USEFUL TIPS\n- It is important to follow the steps and work in groups\n- If the session is online, it is required to work with collaborative online tools (Miro or Mural are good references). For face to face interactions, online tools are also useful as a way of keeping a register of all the ideas that came up during the session.\n- The recommended number of participants for an experienced facilitator is 20, divided in 5 groups.\n\nRESOURCES\n\na. Insights\nAn insight is a deep knowledge about the problem based in both physical (jobs to be done) and emotional evidences (hopes, wishes, fears and frustrations). The team is invited to identify insights based on the teacher's indications or assumptions based on their own experience.\n\nb. Idea generation techniques\nIt includes brainstorming and other techniques derived from it (brainwriting, edge storming, longlist, what if, reverse brainwriting, ...). In all cases, it is about taking inspiration from the user's insights (key knowledge about the need, challenge or problem) to generate a large number of ideas without establishing any limitations in terms of suitability, feasibility or viability at the moment. The bottom line is that the people involved in the process feel free to think and without limitations beyond following the brief of the project, that is, the problem or need that is sought to be solved.\n\nc. Ideas selection techniques\nThe divergent process of idea generation is followed by a convergent process of idea selection. It is about choosing the best ideas based on given criteria. For example, impact, speed of bringing to market, technological knowledge, etc.\n\nd. Definition of the value proposition.\nThe value proposition is defined based on the benefit that the idea generates for the user. It basically formulates how the solution solves the identified problem. There are many techniques for defining the value proposition.

The team analyzes the state of the art, trends, relevant data, and external factors that affect the problem of are restrictions to the problem or need.\u00a0\u00a0After the desk research, the team will have a first inspiration and modeling about what the problem is.\u00a0\n\n##pictures/1.3::pictureI1.png##\n\u00a0\n\nStep 2:\u00a0\u00a0Understanding the Problem (insight identification)\nThe team leaves the office and meets stakeholders (people who know the problem not only because they have it but also because they deal with it). They are the real experts about the problem and the goal is to deep understand it by empathizing with then and observing really what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0Ethnographic research techniques are used (in depth interview, shadowing, in site observation, \u2026).\u00a0\u00a0Based on this research, the team obtains hundreds of observations and generate customer insights.

At this moment the team knows about jobs, hopes, wishes, fears and frustrations from different clients (client archetypes).\u00a0\n\n##pictures/1.3::pictureI3.png##\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 3: Opportunity Identification (creative brief)\nThe insights generated are many. Now it's time to make decisions. To do this, the team must bet on a type of client and a specific approach to the problem. It is not about solving all problems for all types of customers. Once a specific approach is available, it is time to analyze technological and business possibilities to close the design briefing. The briefing is the guide from which the solution is designed. It is formed by a set of design principles that are prescribers about how to reach the solution.\n\n##pictures/1.3::pictureI3.png##\n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 4: Idea Generation and Selection\nBased on the chosen insights (the so-called design principles), an idea generation session is prepared. Some are agreed to run the session (do not criticize, do not play, do not edit the ideas, build on the ideas of others, focus on quantity not quality) and sticky notes are used to relate ideas with the insights.\u00a0\n\nBefore starting, the facilitator can prepare a warm-up session (for example, reviewing the brief, stretching or other ice-breaking exercises). Once this is done, it is time for generating solution ideas related to the Insights. The\u00a0\u00a0mural is used to place the generated ideas.\n\nAfter the generation of ideas, the team selects or combines the large set of ideas into a reduced set, by focusing on the creation of value. To do this, the team analyzes the mural. By looking for patterns and repetitions, ideas are grouped. Once this is done, the team defines criteria for selecting the ideas. With these criteria, the main ideas are prioritized. In the mural, this action corresponds to moving the key ideas to the right area of the mural and highlighting them.\n\n##pictures/1.3::pictureI4.png##\n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 5: Writing the Value Preposition\nThe value proposition is a call to action about the benefit(s) that the idea brings to the user.

Users research with ethnographic techniques\nEthnographic research is the main tool for generating customer insights based on what the customer needs, wants or longs for. A good approach is to understand or identify what causes the user\u2019s frustration, fears or expectations. Ethnographic research comprises a set of tools widely used in marketing and coming from anthropological research. The list of common tools is:\n- The in-depth interview is a type of interview with users and other stakeholders aimed at capturing observations about what they say, do, think and feel.\u00a0\n- On-the-spot observation is another technique aimed at generating real knowledge. It is based on observing the users in their natural environment when they interact with that problem or domain.\n- Shadowing is a type of observation based on following users in what they do in relation to the topic to be investigated. On some occasions, the in-depth interview is complemented with focus groups aimed at capturing knowledge in groups of clients and other stakeholders.\u00a0\n- Surveys can also be used to approach a large set of users.\n\nb. Research of the environment and state of the art\nState-of-the-art research consists of generating insights from the environment using different techniques. Typical techniques can be: market reports, expert interviews, value chain industry analysis, Porter\u2019s five forces analysis, and other resources. Techniques for systematic review of the literature are also included.\n\nc. Trend map\nIt consists of a visual about the trends that influence the topic being investigated. It is about analyzing social, political, economic, demographic, and new technology issues. For doing it there are many divulgation reviews and trend digest web sites (trendwatching.com, springwise.com, trendsdigest.com, TechCrunch, Google Trends, \u2026)\n\nd. Identification of customer insights\nThe identification of user insights starts by linking the findings resulting from the users research with insights from the environment. It is a knowledge synthesis process that is carried out in a group by the entrepreneurial team. To do this, the team uses visual diagrams and sticky notes to identify typical users and their patterns.\n\ne. Idea generation techniques\nIt includes brainstorming and other techniques derived from it (brainwriting, edge storming, longlist, what if, reverse brainwriting, ...). In all cases, it is about taking inspiration from the user's insights (key knowledge about the need, challenge or problem) to generate a large number of ideas without establishing any limitations in terms of suitability, feasibility, or viability at the moment. The bottom line is that the people involved in the process feel free to think and without limitations beyond following the brief of the project, that is, the problem or need that is sought to be solved.\n\nf. Ideas selection techniques\nThe divergent process of idea generation is followed by a convergent process of idea selection. It is about choosing the best ideas based on given criteria. For example, impact, speed of bringing to market, technological knowledge, etc.\n\ng. Definition of the value proposition.\nThe value proposition is defined based on the benefit that the idea generates for the user.

In entrepreneurship, originality comes from creating value for the customer/user, for the organization and/or for the society at large. In entrepreneurship, opportunity arises when there are unsolved problems (or unsatisfied needs) or when the existing solutions can be improved. This might imply not only the design of a new product or service, but a wider range of types of solutions, such as a new relationship with the customer, a new business model, improved processes in a company, etc.\n\nThus, we assume that the original idea is inspired by a problem or need of users, organizations, and/or society. Consequently, the first step in the creative process is to understand in deep the problem or need. The opportunity is a problem not resolved (or an unsatisfied need) or a problem /need that can be resolved better by means of a new technology or a new business approach.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe creative process goes from the problem to the opportunity based on a synthesis process where the client's insights are related to the technological and business possibilities. It is about converting a latent need into an explicit need (a well-posed problem).\u00a0\n\nThe creative method is divided into 4 steps, from creating choices to making choices: 1) Framing the problem, 2) Understanding the problem, 3) Identification of the opportunity, 4) Ideation and 5) Writing the value proposition, 6) Prototyping and testing the value proposition.\n\nPROCESS\nThe creative process requires freedom as well as a certain discipline if what is sought is to create a concept that is attractive to the user, as well as viable for the organization and feasible to carry out. In this sense, support in the form of a repository or visual map is essential. The Lead Ideas Mural and the other maps helps to document the process and then go through it forwards and backwards or iterate as many times as necessary.\n\n\nStep 1: Framing the Problem\n\nThe aim is to contextualize the problem by means of a Desk Research approach. The team analyze the state of the art, trends, relevant data, and external factors that affect the problem of are restrictions to the problem or need. At the end we will have a first inspiration and an idea about what is the problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n##picture/1.3::pictureA1.png##\n\u00a0\n\nStep 2:\u00a0\u00a0Understanding the Problem (insight identification)\nThe team leaves the office and meets stakeholders (people who know the problem not only because he/she has it but also because he/she deal with it). They are the real experts about the problem and the goal is to deep understand it by empathizing with then and observing really what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0Ethnographic research techniques are used (in depth interview, shadowing, in site observation, \u2026).\u00a0\u00a0Based on this research, the team obtain hundreds of observations and generate customer insights.

To do this, the statement includes the customer archetype (user), the benefit (need or problem to solve), and finally the solution, which is a way of grouping the main ideas that have been determined.\n\nStep 6: Prototyping and Testing the VP\nThe value proposition is probably the biggest commitment that the entrepreneur adopts with customers and with him/herself. To push it forward, it will have to mobilize significant resources. It is also a strategic risk because it means ruling out one option in favor of another. To close the process, a prototyping method is imposed. It is about making the idea tangible to validate with clients and make final decisions. It is interesting not only to know the point of view of the participants in the test with prototypes but also to analyze what makes the solution unique and different. In short, it seeks to understand how the solution creates a new experience that makes it different from other alternatives.

Prototyping\u00a0\nThere are different ways to prototype depending on the offer we are developing and the resources we can reach. If there is a FabLab it is interesting to prototyping using 3D printers or a laser cutter. Prototypes with less financial investment are 3D or VR modelling, wireframe or a storyboard. In any case what is important is to test the prototype with the team and/or with other stakeholders. The test consists of letting the participants experiment with the prototype. We let them talk about their experience and actively observe what they do, how they use or what they feel about the concept. We ask them to show us what doesn't work for them or what the experience is like compared to other alternatives they know of.\n\ni. Unique Selling Preposition (USP)\nUSP answers the question why our solution is the most worth buying. Specifically, what makes the solution unique and why our solution is more worthwhile than others. The USP is a powerful message that commits us like a promise. The USP implies a certain positioning in the market.

It is therefore crucial not only to generate new ideas but also to evaluate what potential they have (economically, socially, and culturally).\nHere are two examples of exercises:\nExercise 1:\nSplit the class into four or five groups (depending on the size of participants). Let them think of ideas and let them spend five minutes on the idea, brain-storming on the following parameters:\n- What facts do we know about the idea?\n- What is positive about the idea?\n- What is negative?\n- What kind of feelings do the participants have when they realize the idea?\nAfterward, each group presents their answers and conclusions.\nThe aim of this exercise is to be conscious, that every idea has different points and aspects.\n\nExercise 2:\nAs a first step, let the participants in groups create a mind map with different aspects of an idea and what aspects should be considered (economic, social, and cultural).\n\n\u00a0In a second step, the participants are asked to develop strategies to make the most out of the idea.\nAfterward, each group presents their results.\n\nThe first step to be able to identify good ideas is to assess their time-adjusted value. There are two key questions to ask, when making this assessment:\n\nHow valuable is the idea?\n\u00a0- How differentiated is the product or service idea?\n\u00a0- What is the future market size: how large is the market actually, how fast is it projected to grow?\n\u00a0- Does the idea generate a new market? How large could this become?\n\u00a0- When could the new product or service be launched?\n\nHow quickly does an idea lose value?\n\u00a0- How quickly could the competitors respond?\n\u00a0- How else could the benefit of the idea be delivered?\n\n2) The term \u201cvalue\u201d in social, economic, and cultural terms:\nSocial and cultural value:\nSocial and cultural value is about people and the positive and negative impact their actions have on other people, society, business, the economy, and the environment. Social value has an impact on health, well-being, diverse thinking and inclusion, innovation, and on productivity. Social value is not about \u201cdoing or being good\u201d. It is about the value people, the business sector, and industry creates for society, the economy, and the environment. Social value underlines that all decisions and actions have an impact on other people, society, the economy, and the environment.\nEconomic value:\nEconomic value is the value that a person attaches to a good or service based on the benefits they derive from it. In terms of evaluating ideas, this means that an idea that has economic value has the potential to generate profits. The value of the win can be measured by how much money could be made. Ideally, the idea should create a sustainable profit over time.\n\n3) Appropriate license for the purpose of protecting the value created by an idea:\nTo protect an idea it is crucial to secure the appropriate type(s) of intellectual property, i.e. licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets. If the idea is not protected or not protected in the right way, the ownership of the idea could be loosed. A good overview on all forms of protecting ideas gives the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO, https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/).\nSTEP 3: Presentation and evaluation\nEach participant presents an idea based on which they can apply what they have learned about different values (social, economic and cultural) of ideas and licenses.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "Resources for the introduction:\n\n- How can I estimate the value of new product ideas?

For example, phase Learning is happening along the process. However, it might be helpful that the facilitator provides time for the students to identify and reflect on their learnings. That is why it is important that the facilitator has these phases in mind. Transference refers to the ability to apply the learnings of the lesson to the thinking and behaviour of their participant in real scenarios, beyond the scenarios and the cases worked on in class.\nThe contents of each session are detailed as follows.\n\nSESSION 1 \u2013 Introduction to Ethical Thinking & Behaviour\n\nThe aim of this module is to make participants gain awareness of the importance of ethics in entrepreneurship and to be able to reason and behave ethically in life.\n\n1.1. What is ethics?\nThe session can start by asking the participants to provide a definition of ethics in their own words. Each participant can write their own ideas in a post-it and then, read them aloud. Then, the instructor can provide several definitions coming from literature (e.g., Farrell, 2017, p.3):\n\n- \u201cAccording to Toffler (1986) ethical questions have to do with the notions of right and wrong as noted by the perspectives of individuals and institutions in the society they are in.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to reach a common understanding of what ethics is. Also, the instructor can bring the topic of ethical conflict by providing a definition and asking the participants to provide examples of ethical conflicts in business and entrepreneurship.\n\n- Def. Ethical conflict: \u201cAn individual perceives that his/her duties and responsibilities towards one group are inconsistent with his/her responsibilities towards some other group including one\u2019s self\u201d (Hunt et al., 1984, p.310).\n\n1.2. Drawing your Personal Values\n\nEthics is also related to honesty, integrity, and behaving according to their own values. In this part of the session, the participants are asked to list their core values and draw them on a mind map. In this mind map, the participants write their name (or drawing or picture) in the centre, and around the name, they list the key values that drive their thought and behaviour. For each core value, the participants are asked to provide a sentence or slogan that describes that value.\n\nThe participants can show and pitch their drawings to the rest of the group. As a final reflection, the instructor asks the participants about the differences between behaving according to their values and behaving ethically. The following text may help guide the discussion:\n\n- \u201cActing with integrity means acting according to your own personal set of values and principles, which are different for everyone. Behaving ethically means behaving according to a set of standards that are the same for everyone, at least for everyone in the same culture. Acting with integrity and behaving ethically build your credibility.\u201d (Cole, 2013, p. 177)\n\n1.3. Identifying moral wrongs\nFollowing the discussion on the differences between personal values and ethical principles, the instructor asks the participants to identify ethical standards that are commonly agreed on a given culture.\n\nFor this purpose, the participants are asked to write a list of moral wrongs, i.e., list of behaviours that are generally considered wrong behaviours in our culture (i.e., \u201ccheating in an exam\u201d). To help the participants come up with a long list, these can be divided in several domains:\n\n- Academic settings\n- Social situations\n- Business\n- Sports\n- Workplace\n- Environment\n\nThe participants can work in teams and then, share their answers with the whole group. The instructor moderates the discussion.\n\nThe instructor can access a list of moral wrongs in https://utas.shorthandstories.com/PP_Ethics/index.html\n\n1.4. Personal reflection\nTo close the session, the participants are invited to reflect critically on their own (current and past) behaviour. This can be done off-session, by taking notes in a diary.\n\nSome guiding questions can be provided to help participants interpret their actions in an ethical way (see the Ethics Centre):\n1. Would I be happy for this decision to be headlining the news tomorrow? (\u201cSunlight Test\u201d)\n2. Is there an ethical non-negotiable at play?\n3. Will my action make the world a better place?\n4. What would happen if everybody did this?\n5. What will this do to my character or the character of my organisation?\n6. Is this consistent with my values and principles?\n\n1.5. Closing\nThe facilitator asks the participants to summarise the learnings of the lesson in one sentence, write this down in a notebook and then, share it aloud with the remaining participants. This practice helps the participant review the contents and learnings of the class, and generates higher commitment by sharing these learnings with peers.\n\u2026\u2026..\n\nSESSION 2 - Introduction to accountability\nThe aim of this session is to raise awareness on the concept of accountability among the participants, applied to scenarios of everyday life.\n\n2.1. Story\nThe facilitator starts by telling a story about accountability. The story can refer to a common scenario related to the audience.\n\nFor example, if the audience consists of students, the story could be:\n\u201cJohn is studying a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. In order to gain some financial independence, he decided to take a job every afternoon, from 3-7pm. When he arrives at home, he is too tired to study or work on the assignments from university. During the weekend, he often procrastinates and tries to catch up with his assignments on late Sunday. The quality of his work is often not good enough, although he is not aware of it. When the deadline for one of the assignments is approaching, he complains that the professor gives too much work and asks him for an extended deadline, but the professor rejects his demand. He finally fails the assignment and becomes very angry. He decides to write a complaint to the Dean with his version of the story and the professor is called to the Dean\u2019s office to provide explanation of what happened.\u201d\n\nIn the context of an organisation, the facilitator can make up a similar story with an employee and her boss.\n\nStorytelling fosters more engagement among the participants and helps break the ice so that the participants can participate early in the session. After the story, the facilitator can ask several questions for discussion:\n\n- What is John\u2019s behaviour?\n- What are the consequences of his behaviour?\n- Could John have behave differently and how?\n- From John\u2019s perspective, who is the responsible that he failed the assignment?\n- Is John aware of his accountability?\n- How would you define accountability?\n\n2.2. What is accountability?\nIn this part of the session, the facilitator provides definitions to accountability:\n\n- Accountability is an obligation to inform about, and justify one\u2019s conduct to an authority (Novelli et al., 2022).\n\n- More formally, accountability denotes a relation between an agent A and (what is usually called) a forum F, such that A must justify A\u2019s conduct to F, and F supervises, asks questions to and passes judgment on A on the basis of such justification (Bovens 2007, 450). Both A and F need not be natural, individual persons, and may be groups or legal persons (Novelli et al., 2022).\n\n\nAlthough these definitions might be a bit technical, the definitions may help the participant to reason about the case with more tools. The facilitator can relate the definitions to the case just exposed and ask the following questions:\n- Who is the \u201caccountable agent A\u201d in the previous story?\n- Who is the authority in this case?\n- What are the A\u2019s tasks and responsibilities?\n- What evidence can the authority gather to pass judgment on A?\n- What are the learnings for A?\n\nAccountability can also be related to the context of delegation (see Novelli et al., 2022 for details).\n\n2.3. The Accountability Pathway\nThe Accountability Pathway approach considers accountability as a process consisting of eight phases (Jolie Bain Pillsbury, n.d.).\n1. Unaware\n2. Blame Oth\u00acers\n3. \u201cI Can\u2019t\u201d Excuses\n4. Wait and Hope\n5. Acknowledge Reality\n6. Own Action Commitment\n7. Find Solutions\n8. Make It Happen\nBefore introducing the Accountability Pathway, the facilitator can ask the students to classify these actions in accountable or non-accountable and then, sort them in ascending order from less to more accountability. This concept can be again related to the study case, by asking in which state of accountability John is.\n\nSee pictures and templates in http://www.sherbrookeconsulting.com/products.htm\n\n2.4. Identifying your accountability\nThis is a personal reflection exercise, where the participant is invited to reflect on their own (current or past) responsibilities and commitments, evaluate the degree of completion, and then, reflect on their development stage with respect to the accountability pathway.\nThe task is as follows:\n1. Write a list of all your main responsibilities/tasks (at home, work, university)\n2. Write a list of other commitments that you have made with others (friends, relatives, colleagues, your boss, etc).\n3. If applicable, write the start date, deadline (if any), and the level of completion/achievement of these tasks and commitments.\n4. What actions are you taking in each task or commitment?\n5. What are the consequences of these actions (or lack of action)?\n6. Finally, reflect on it. Do you see any general pattern or behaviour?\n7. Where are you in the accountability pathway?\n8. What can you do to progress along the accountability pathway?\n\nSee \u201cAccountability Awareness\u201d template.\n\n2.5. Closing\nThe facilitator asks the participants to summarise the learnings of the lesson and share it aloud with the remaining participants. In order to introduce some innovation, the facilitator can ask the participants to draw the learning rather than writing, which was done in the previous session.\n.....\nSESSION 3 - Introduction to sustainability\nThe goal of this session is to raise awareness on economic progress and its impact on sustainability and society by providing food for thought and opportunities for reflection and discussion.\n3.1. Awareness\nThe session can start by raising awareness about the consequences of current progress on the environment and society. One way of raising awareness is to watch a conference or documentary in the session.\nExamples:\nImpact over the environment (landscape): Pictures and documentary by Edward Burtynsky (photographer):\n- Manufactured Landscapes documentary (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufactured_Landscapes)\n- TED Talk: Manufactured landscapes and green education: https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_burtynsky_my_wish_manufactured_landscapes_and_green_education\n- TED Talk, Landscape of oil: https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_burtynsky_photographing_the_landscape_of_oil\nImpact on society:\n- Workers (1993), photographs by Sebastian Salgado on the extreme working conditions of men and women around the world (often in underdeveloped countries): https://www.polkagalerie.com/en/sebastiao-salgado-works-genesis.htm\nAfter watching the videos, the facilitator can ask the participants to share their opinions about economic progress and its impact on society and the environment.\n\n3.2. Sustainability\nIn this part of the session, the facilitator can provide inputs on the definition of sustainability and the three pillars of sustainable development, as it can be seen below.\nThe report \u201cOur common future\u201d defines sustainable development as:\n\u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d\nThe report was published in October 1987 by the United Nations through Oxford University Press. It is also known as the Brundtland Report, named after Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who led the World Commission on Environment and Development. It can be accessed through the link:\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common-future.pdf\nThere are three (+1) pillars of sustainable development:\n- Social sustainability: in broad terms, this pillar refers to the preservation of human rights, basic needs, and well-being of all people, encompassing issues such as access to food and water, education and health.\n- Environmental sustainability: keeping in balance all earth\u2019s environmental systems, while natural resources within them are consumed by humans at a rate in which they are able to replenish themselves.\n- Economic sustainability: human communities across the globe are able to maintain their independence and have access to resources that they require, financial or other, to meet their needs (Univ Alberta). Economic developments can accelerate social development by providing opportunities for underprivileged groups or by spreading education more rapidly (our common future, Chapter 2 http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm )\n- In the last years, culture has been emphasized as the fourth pillar of sustainability. Culture can be defined as the beliefs and attitudes about something that people in a particular group or organization share (Oxford\u2019s dictionary). Culture represents a particular way of perceiving, knowing, and interacting with the environment. There is a knowledge that comes from culture which is expected to last as long as the race or institution exists.\nThis input can set the basis for the next input on SDGs. To make the session more interactive, the facilitator can ask the students to work on one of these pillars. As follows, there is an example of an activity that can be done in the pillar of social progress.\n\n3.3. Social Progress\nThis part of the session proposes an activity to work more deeply on one of the pillars, social progress (similar activities could be held in the other pillars as well):\n- Reading an article about economic progress and social progress: \u201cWhy social progress matters\u201d by World Economic Forum (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/04/why-social-progress-matters/)\n- Ask the participants to list a set of aspects or factors that are related to the social progress of a community. For example, health and education.\n- The facilitator introduces the Social Progress Index (SPI). Reference of the methodology: https://www.socialprogress.org/2020-Social-Progress-Index-Methodology.pdf\n- The facilitator can show the Social Index report with the results of the latest SPI measured across all countries: https://www.socialprogress.org/index/global/results; https://www.socialprogress.org/\n\n3.4. Exercise\nIn this exercise, the participants work in teams. The participants are asked to identify a set of practices connected to their everyday lives that are sustainable and not sustainable, categorized under the four pillars identified before (economic, social, environmental, and cultural). This can be written and shared with post-its. After the exercise, each team selects and prepares a pitch for one sustainable and non-sustainable practice in each of the four pillars.\n\n3.5. Introduction to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nThe SDGs enshrine a conceptual shift in thinking about development beyond economic growth \u2014 envisioning a desirable future that is equitable, inclusive, peaceful, and environmentally sustainable. The 17 SDGs represent an urgent call to action at a global scale structured in the three pillars, i.e., social, environmental, and economic. Recently, culture has been recognized to be at the heart of development policies within the framework of SDGs (Hosagrahar, 2017).\nThe facilitator can introduce the 17 SDGs and then, ask the participants to revise the previous exercise and match the sustainable and unsustainable practices to one or several SDGs.\n\n3.6.

For example, phase Learning is happening along the process. However, it might be helpful that the facilitator provides time for the students to identify and reflect on their learnings. That is why it is important that the facilitator has these phases in mind. Transference refers to the ability to apply the learnings of the lesson to the thinking and behaviour of their participant in real scenarios, beyond the scenarios and the cases worked on in class.\n\nThe contents of each session are detailed as follows.\n\n\n1. Introduction to Ethics and Sustainability\nThe instructor can introduce the session by asking the participants to define ethics and then, providing some definitions. The following paragraph from Farrell (2018) might provide a good context:\n\nThe word ethics comes from the Greek words ethos and ethikos. According to Toffler (1986), ethos is translated as character and ethikos as \u201cthe theory of living\u201d. Ethics were defined as \u201crules or standards\u201d and morality as \u201crelating to principles of right and wrong\u201d. Most definitions of ethics have to do with the idea of actions either being right or wrong (Morris et al., 2002, p332). According to Toffler (1986), ethical questions have to do with the notions of right and wrong as noted by the perspectives of individuals and institutions in the society they are in. Therefore, ethics deals with the distinction between what is right and wrong and has to do with the nature and grounds of morality, including moral judgements, standards and rules of conduct (Taylor, 1975). Ethical management is reflected in the character of the manager and through the work ethic and decision-making\u201d (Farrell, 2018, p. 3)\n\nIn this session, the participants will identify ethical dilemmas that entrepreneurs often face and reflect on potential dilemmas that they might be facing. Thus, before working on ethical dilemmas, the instructor can ask again the participants for definitions of \u201cethical dilemma\u201d. After the interchange of ideas among the participants, the instructor can refer to Farrell\u2019s (2018) review of the entrepreneurial dilemma:\n\n\u201cThere can be ethical conflict when \u201c an individual perceives that his/her duties and responsibilities towards one group are inconsistent with his/her responsibilities towards some other group including one\u2019s self\u201d (Hunt et al., 1984, p.310). According to Liedtka (1989), there can be two types of conflict: conflict within the individual resulting from the individual\u2019s value hierarchy, and conflict between individual values and organizational values. Friedman (1997) says that stockholder theory states that managers (as agents of stockholders) should behave in a manner that conforms to the basic rules of society, as embodied in law and ethical custom.\u201d (Farrell, 2018, p.5).\n\nFinally, to include sustainability as part of the ethical dilemmas that some businesses and entrepreneurs might face, the instructor can foster contributions from the participants to definitions for sustainability. Some definitions provided by some authors are:\n- \u201cThe possibility that humans and other life will flourish on earth forever\u201d (Ehrenfeld, 2008, p.49; cited in Farrell, 2018)\n- \u201cDevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d (Our Common Future, n.d.).\n\n2. Ethical challenges in business\nTo introduce the topic of ethics in business and entrepreneurship, the instructor can show the following video:\n\n- The Slippery Slope to Major fraud-Diann Cattani: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvQEwT5_uFw\n\nAlso, some cases can be presented to raise awareness:\n\n- New York department stores:\nPrestigious New York department stores, several of our respondents told us, cavalierly break promises to suppliers.\n\u201cYou send the department store an invoice for $55,000 and they send you $38,000. If you question it they say, \u2018Here is an $11,000 penalty for being two days late; here is the transportation tax and a dockage fee\u2026you didn\u2019t follow our shipping instructions, Clause 42, Section 3C. You used the wrong carrier.\u2019 And half the time they call the order in and send the 600-page confirming document later, and they say you didn\u2019t follow our order.\u201d (Bhid\u00e9 & Stevenson, 1990)\n- Other cases can be found in Bhid\u00e9 & Stevenson\u2019s (1990) article: \u201cWhy Be Honest if Honesty Doesn\u2019t Pay\u201d published in Harvard Business Review.\n\n3. Ethical challenges in entrepreneurship\n\nTo focus on the topic of ethical behaviour in entrepreneurship, the instructor can refer to extant research on whether entrepreneurs are more/less driven by ethical values than managers and what ethical difficulties they may face in their new ventures. Hannafey (2003) suggests that ethical thinking and behaviour may be challenging for entrepreneurs who often struggle with conditions of significant business and moral uncertainty. He identifies several areas where entrepreneurs could face ethical dilemmas:\n\u00a7 Social effects: These may include economic harm and environmental degradation.\n\u00a7 Direct financial gain: Entrepreneurs often face severe capital and liquidity constraints. This may influence the entrepreneurs\u2019 moral perceptions and judgements about financial matters.\n\u00a7 Relationships: Personal relations (friends, family, employees, investors and others) may be influenced along the development of the new venture. There might be special complications when family members and friends lend money to the new venture. Other ethical dilemmas may arise if entrepreneurs relate to others in transactional or instrumental ways.\n\u00a7 Promotion of the venture: This includes the dilemma of how much information to disclose about the venture, tactics used to influence investment, and bargaining tactics (Hannafey 2003, pp. 102-5).\nKirk Hanson (2015), author of the article \u201cA Good Start: Ethics for Entrepreneurs-Eleven Key Steps\u201d suggests eleven key steps for new ventures to take ethics into account. The first step is:\n1. Recognise the ethical dilemmas that surround them in the first few months. That is, entrepreneurs keep in mind that things can get difficult in the first while, and put ethical practices into place right from the start.\nSome of the ethical dilemmas that entrepreneurs may face, as mentioned by the author are:\n\u201cHow much puffery do you use in presenting your idea to venture capitalists? How do you divide stock ownership and options fairly among the founding team and later hires? How reliable does a product have to be before you ship it? How creative can you be in your accounting when the value of your stock is so sensitive to a stumble? When a deal falls through, how quickly do you tell your board and your funders? How generous can you afford to be in employee benefits in the early days?\u201d (Hanson, 2015).\n\n4. \u201cMy entrepreneurial dilemmas\u201d\nBased on Hanson\u2019s suggestion, the instructor asks the participants to identify the ethical and sustainability dilemmas that they face in their value-creating activity or new venture. Every participant is invited to write a list of the dilemmas in their new venture. Participants can read the list aloud to share it with the whole group or do so in small teams of three or four people.\nThe aim of this activity is to raise awareness among the participants of the ethical dilemmas that they might be facing as entrepreneurs, employees, or citizens.\u00a0\n\n5. Entrepreneurial dilemma: Awareness\nOnce the participants have identified some ethical and sustainability dilemmas, they are asked to select one, which could be the most critical one according to their own judgment. For a given dilemma, the participant is asked to:\n- identify the stakeholders affected by these dilemmas, including society and the environment,\n- reflect on different solutions and\n- their potential effects.\nTo guide the participants through the process, they can fill out the template \u201cEntrepreneurial Ethical Dilemma\u201d (section \u201cAwareness\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The participants can work on more than one dilemma if they want to.\nFinally, sharing all the ideas and listening to others\u2019 reflections is very beneficial to broaden the different perspectives and further develop empathy.\n6. Entrepreneurial dilemma: From awareness to commitment to action\nBeyond ethical awareness, behaving ethically involves deciding the right action and being committed to it.\nAccording to Trevi\u00f1o and Brown (2004), there are four stages required to behave ethically:\n1. Becoming aware that there is a moral issue.\n2. Making a judgment \u2013 that is, deciding which specific action is morally justifiable.\n3. Becoming motivated \u2013 committing or intending to take moral action.\n4. Showing moral character \u2013 actually following through.\nBased on this reflection, every participant is now invited to select one of the dilemmas that they worked on previously, and complete steps 2-3 of this process. This means that after pondering the different actions and their consequences, the participant needs to decide on the best course of action and commit themselves to the corresponding actions. The participants are invited to fill in the template \u201cEntrepreneurial Ethical Dilemma\u201d, sections \u201cJudgement\u201d and \u201cCommitment\u201d.\n7. Learnings\nTo close the session, every participant is invited to share their own learnings (takeaways) of the session.\n8. Further Reflection & Learning Transference\nBefore closing the session, the instructor asks the participants to read the article \u201cA Good Start: Ethics for Entrepreneurs-Eleven Key Steps\u201d by Hanson (2015).

Introduction\nThe goal of this session is to raise awareness of sustainability issues associated with the new venture and to provide methods and tools to assess and measure impact. Additionally, the participants will learn the differences between inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts and will be able to identify how the value proposal (new venture) develops in these aspects.\n\n2. Sustainability and Entrepreneurship\nThe instructor starts the session by inspiring participants on the need of tackling sustainability, given the current societal and environmental challenges.\nNext, the instructor can mention examples of the current shift of today\u2019s businesses and organisations from an economic focus towards a more responsible and sustainable focus:\n- The Net Positive Manifesto (Polman & Winston, 2021): https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-net-positive-manifesto\n- Coca-Cola\u2019s sustainable business: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/sustainable-business\n- Amazon Sustainability: https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/\n-\u00a0\u00a0Meta\u2019s Sustainability Report : https://sustainability.fb.com/2021-sustainability-report/\nAlso, entrepreneurship is affected by this shift in many aspects:\n- It\u2019s Official: Customers prefer sustainable companies (Houlihan & Harvey, 2018) https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324001\n- Why Startups Can\u2019t Afford To Ignore Sustainability In 2021 (Dyrnes, 2021): https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/01/07/why-startups-cant-afford-to-ignore-sustainability-in-2021/\nAccording to The Net Positive Manifesto (Polman & Winston, 2021):\n- Companies must take ownership of all company impacts\n- Net positive companies propose solutions rather than wait for regulations\n- For their own good, companies must play an active role in solving our biggest shared challenges.\nThe session follows by a hands-on activity whose title is extracted from The Net Positive Manifesto.\n3. \u201cIs the world better off because your company is in it?\u201d \u2013 A Hands-on activity\nTo introduce the activity, the instructor reviews the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, n.d.; UNDP, 2022) and reviews them according to the three areas: economic, environmental and societal.\n\n##pictures/1.6::pictureA1##\nFigure 1: The 17 Goals (United Nations, n.d.).\n\nAn alternative representation of SDGs is provided by the Wedding Cake Model, which emphasizes the hierarchy of SDGs goals (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.):\n1. Basis: a healthy biosphere\n2. Fair society\n3. Economy\n\n##pictures/1.6::pictureA2##\nFigure 2: The SDGs wedding cake (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.. Credit: Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University CC BY-ND 3.0.\n\nAfter this introduction, the participants are invited to go through the SDGs and select the SDGs (maximum, three) in which their new venture is going to have a greater impact. For each SDG, the participants are required to specify which concrete solutions can create an impact. For example, if \u201cClimate action\u201d is selected in a new venture, some actions could be:\n- Use of recyclable materials\n- Green mobility in deliveries to customer\n\u00a0Every solution should be written in a post-it.\nThe aim of this activity is to raise awareness of the solutions that can be implemented to foster sustainability in a new venture.\n\n4. Inputs-Outputs-Outcomes-Impacts\nThe terms outputs, outcomes, and impact are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings. See the following extract from Phineo (2017):\n\u201cIn order to be able to achieve these objectives (target group\u2019s needs or identified opportunity), certain inputs (resources) must be available. From these resources, the project produces outputs (products and services). If these are utilized by the target individuals, this provides a foundation for achieving the desired results at the target-group level (outcomes). Results at the target-group level can in the next step contribute to results at the societal level (impact). This leads to a change in societal conditions, which in turn may generate new needs\u2026\u201d (p. 45).\n\n5. \u201cIdentify your IOOI\u201d. Hands-on activity\nFollowing the previous hands-on activity, participants are now asked to:\n- Identify the inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts of a solution, value proposition or new venture on a target group, the society and the environment.\nTo do that, the participants can use the impact staircase (see below). Every input is written in a post-it on the corresponding level of the staircase. Alternatively, you can use the Template Results staircase (Phineo, 2017).\n\n##pictures/1.6::pictureA3##\nFigure 3: Impact staircase. Source: Phineo (2017).\n\n6. Defining Indicators and monitoring progress. Hands-on activity\nOnce the desired IOOIs are identified in the impact staircase, the participants should provide indicators to measure whether the intended goals are achieved. Indicators can be seen as \u201cevidence\u201d of achievement.\nIndicators should be defined in the planning phase, to set the degree of achievement that is required. During the new venture\u2019s development, indicators are an important instrument to monitor progress and learn from it. Indicators should be defined for the various levels of the staircase.\nAccording to the provided template, an indicator should fulfil a given aim or goal at a certain level (input, output, outcome, impact). Every indicator should have a target value (desired result) and a baseline value (departing point). The indicators and target values are to be measured on a given period of time to allow for monitoring and learning.\n\n##pictures/1.6::pictureA4##\nFigure 4: Template Indicators (Phineo,2017).\n\nSee Phineo (2017) for a detailed explanation about setting indicators for IOOIs.\nImpact metrics can also be specified in the Lean Impact Canvas. The Lean Impact Canvas is an adaptation of the Lean Canvas (Maurya, 2015). It contains two new segments: purpose and impact metrics. Purpose refers to the mission of the new venture or organisation (i.e., \u201cWhat is the intendent positive impact of the new venture on people and the environment?). Impact metrics are measurable and objective data that can be designed and measured to account for the intended purpose. See below.\n\n##pictures/1.6::pictureA5##\nFigure 5: Lean Impact Canvas.

Content-wise the focus is on leadership, motivation and change management.\nUnit 1: Introduction\nThis unit gives an introduction and mainly focuses on why mobilizing others is important for driving change. The goal is to introduce the course, its learning objectives and structure including assessment types. Content-wise the focus will be on understanding the dynamics of leadership as well as different approaches to leadership and change management (transformational leadership, servant leadership, agile leadership, change management frameworks).\nUnit 2: Identifying Stakeholder Groups\nLet your participants broaden their stakeholder base and develop a stakeholder map to identify the stakeholders with the highest interest and most influence so that they can approach them first for support of their cause. This requires active listening.\u00a0\nExercise on active listening: This exercise can be delivered in person or online through video conferencing platforms. It can also be practiced in groups of three or more, with participants taking turns as the speaker and listener.\n1. Find a partner and decide who will go first as the speaker.\n2. The speaker will share a personal experience or story with the listener. This could be something positive or negative, but it should be something that the speaker feels comfortable sharing.\n3. As the listener, your goal is to fully engage with the speaker and demonstrate your understanding and empathy.\n4. Practice the following active listening techniques:\u00a0\n- Pay attention to the speaker and maintain eye contact.\n- Listen for the speaker's main message and take note of any key details.\n- Ask open-ended questions to clarify your understanding.\n- Paraphrase what the speaker said to ensure that you understand correctly.\n- Reflect on the speaker's emotions and provide validation or support.\n5. After the speaker has finished sharing, switch roles and repeat the exercise.\nAdvanced: To make this exercise more challenging, you can introduce distractions or barriers to communication. For example, you could have the speaker wear a mask or listen to music while speaking, or you could introduce background noise or other distractions to simulate a noisy environment. This will require the listener to demonstrate even greater focus and attention to fully engage with the speaker.\nUnit 3: Mobilization Plan and Strategies\nParticipants will engage the key stakeholders of the group to find out what their needs are. They will identify the problems that need solutions together and then look deeper to identify the root cause of each problem. Get the members to actively participate in coming up with possible solutions and write down all the ideas. Set goals based on what they hope to achieve when implementing a solution.\u00a0\u00a0Allocate time and set deadlines for each task to be completed.\nExercise on developing a mobilization plan:\n1. Identify a specific goal or objective that you want to achieve. This could be a personal or professional goal, but it should be something that requires mobilizing others to support you.\n2 Define the goal or objective in specific, measurable terms. What exactly do you want to achieve, and how will you measure success?\n3 Identify the key stakeholders and influencers who can help you achieve your goal. Who are the people or groups that you need to engage and mobilize to achieve your goal?\n4. Develop a mobilization strategy that outlines how you will engage and motivate these stakeholders and influencers to support your goal. Your strategy should include:\n- A clear message that articulates your vision and the benefits of achieving your goal\n- A plan for reaching out to key stakeholders and influencers through various communication channels (e.g., email, social media, phone, in-person meetings)\n- A timeline for implementing your mobilization plan and achieving your goal\n- A budget or resource plan that outlines the costs and resources required to implement your mobilization plan\n5. Identify potential barriers or challenges to implementing your mobilization plan and develop strategies to address them. What are the potential obstacles that could prevent you from achieving your goal, and how will you overcome them?\nAdvanced: To make this exercise more challenging, you can introduce additional constraints or limitations. For example, you could limit the budget or resources available to implement the mobilization plan, or you could require participants to develop a plan that targets a specific audience or demographic.\nUnit 4: Implementing Mobilization Strategies\nParticipants will practice implementing mobilization strategies, which involve engaging and motivating others to support their vision and drive change.

They will work with a partner or small group.\nExercise on how to monitor the success of mobilization:\n1. Review the mobilization plan that you have developed for a specific goal or objective.\n2. Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that you will use to measure the success of your mobilization plan. These KPIs should be specific, measurable, and relevant to your goal or objective.\n3. Set targets for each KPI, based on the desired outcomes of your mobilization plan.\n4. Implement a system for tracking and monitoring progress towards your KPI targets. This could be a simple spreadsheet or more complex project management software.\n5. Regularly review and analyze the data on your KPIs to determine whether your mobilization plan is on track to achieve its goals. Identify any areas where progress is lagging or where you are exceeding your targets.\n6. Based on your analysis, make adjustments to your mobilization plan as needed.

Each unit consists of a short introduction to the topic with pertinent information, a small selection of links to further information, and a set of tasks that require the learner to engage actively with the topic. Content-wise the focus is on leadership, motivation and change management.\nUnit 1: Introduction\nThis unit gives an introduction and mainly focuses on why mobilizing others is important for driving change. The goal is to introduce the course, its learning objectives and structure including assessment types. Content-wise the focus will be on understanding the dynamics of leadership as well as different approaches to leadership and change management (transformational leadership, servant leadership, agile leadership, change management frameworks).\nUnit 2: Identifying Stakeholder Groups\nLet your participants broaden their stakeholder base and develop a stakeholder map to identify the stakeholders with the highest interest and most influence so that they can approach them first for support of their cause. This requires active listening.\u00a0\nExercise on active listening: This exercise can be delivered in person or online through video conferencing platforms. It can also be practiced in groups of three or more, with participants taking turns as the speaker and listener.\n1. Find a partner and decide who will go first as the speaker.\n2. The speaker will share a personal experience or story with the listener. This could be something positive or negative, but it should be something that the speaker feels comfortable sharing.\n3. As the listener, your goal is to fully engage with the speaker and demonstrate your understanding and empathy.\n4. Practice the following active listening techniques:\u00a0\n- Pay attention to the speaker and maintain eye contact.\n- Listen for the speaker's main message and take note of any key details.\n- Ask open-ended questions to clarify your understanding.\n- Paraphrase what the speaker said to ensure that you understand correctly.\n- Reflect on the speaker's emotions and provide validation or support.\n5. After the speaker has finished sharing, switch roles and repeat the exercise.\nAdvanced: To make this exercise more challenging, you can introduce distractions or barriers to communication. For example, you could have the speaker wear a mask or listen to music while speaking, or you could introduce background noise or other distractions to simulate a noisy environment. This will require the listener to demonstrate even greater focus and attention to fully engage with the speaker.\nUnit 3: Mobilization Plan and Strategies\nParticipants will engage the key stakeholders of the group to find out what their needs are. They will identify the problems that need solutions together and then look deeper to identify the root cause of each problem. Get the members to actively participate in coming up with possible solutions and write down all the ideas. Set goals based on what they hope to achieve when implementing a solution.\u00a0\u00a0Allocate time and set deadlines for each task to be completed.\nExercise on developing a mobilization plan:\n1. Identify a specific goal or objective that you want to achieve. This could be a personal or professional goal, but it should be something that requires mobilizing others to support you.\n2 Define the goal or objective in specific, measurable terms. What exactly do you want to achieve, and how will you measure success?\n3 Identify the key stakeholders and influencers who can help you achieve your goal. Who are the people or groups that you need to engage and mobilize to achieve your goal?\n4. Develop a mobilization strategy that outlines how you will engage and motivate these stakeholders and influencers to support your goal. Your strategy should include:\n- A clear message that articulates your vision and the benefits of achieving your goal\n- A plan for reaching out to key stakeholders and influencers through various communication channels (e.g., email, social media, phone, in-person meetings)\n- A timeline for implementing your mobilization plan and achieving your goal\n- A budget or resource plan that outlines the costs and resources required to implement your mobilization plan\n5. Identify potential barriers or challenges to implementing your mobilization plan and develop strategies to address them. What are the potential obstacles that could prevent you from achieving your goal, and how will you overcome them?\nAdvanced: To make this exercise more challenging, you can introduce additional constraints or limitations. For example, you could limit the budget or resources available to implement the mobilization plan, or you could require participants to develop a plan that targets a specific audience or demographic.\nUnit 4: Implementing Mobilization Strategies\nParticipants will practice implementing mobilization strategies, which involve engaging and motivating others to support their vision and drive change. Participants will work with a partner or small group to implement a mobilization strategy and evaluate its effectiveness.\nExercise on how to implement a mobilization strategy: Based on the mobilization plan and strategy developed in Unit 3, participants will Implement their mobilization strategy, working with a partner or small group to reach out to key stakeholders and influencers and engage them in their vision.\u00a0\n- Track your progress and adjust your strategy as needed.\n- Evaluate the effectiveness of your mobilization strategy by measuring its impact on achieving your goal. What worked well, and what could be improved for future mobilization efforts?\nUnit 5: Monitoring Success\nParticipants will monitor to see whether their efforts were successful or not and where they will need to make adjustments in their mobilization plan. They will work with a partner or small group.\nExercise on how to monitor the success of mobilization:\n1. Review the mobilization plan that you have developed for a specific goal or objective.\n2. Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that you will use to measure the success of your mobilization plan. These KPIs should be specific, measurable, and relevant to your goal or objective.\n3. Set targets for each KPI, based on the desired outcomes of your mobilization plan.\n4. Implement a system for tracking and monitoring progress towards your KPI targets. This could be a simple spreadsheet or more complex project management software.\n5. Regularly review and analyze the data on your KPIs to determine whether your mobilization plan is on track to achieve its goals. Identify any areas where progress is lagging or where you are exceeding your targets.\n6. Based on your analysis, make adjustments to your mobilization plan as needed. This could include revising your messaging, changing your outreach strategy, or reallocating resources to areas where they will have a greater impact.\n7.

This platform provides a lot of useful information and input for designing and implementing a course to foster digital competences. First, it provides an overview of the definition of digital competencies. Moreover, methodological and theoretical considerations to map digital skills with the Digital Competence Wheel are presented. We suggest using the Digital Competence Wheel to assess the competencies of the participants before and after the course. Finally, four areas of digital competencies are introduced (Skov, 2016):\n1. INFORMATION: identification, organization and analysis of digital information.\n2. COMMUNICATION: communication and interaction virtually.\n3. PRODUCTION: creation and editing of digital content.\n4. SAFETY: consideration of rights and duties, strengths and risks, opportunities and threats when working with ICT.\u00a0\nThese areas can serve as teaching blocks and a guide to structure the course, learning goals and content. We suggest a collaborative teaching and peer learning approach for this module.\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE:\nThis module is designed to expose participants to a range of digital tools and topics that are useful for participants\u2019 personal and professional development as a student and as a professional. After an introduction to the program (see Unit 0), participants will be spending about 60 minutes each week working through several tasks designed to encourage engagement with the tools and topics of that week and to reflect on how they could be useful in their own context. New content, tasks and further information are released each week on a digital learning platform, and participants get an email reminder to complete the tasks, which they can do at their own pace and in their own time.\nEach module consists of a short introduction to the topic with pertinent information, a small selection of links to further information, and a set of tasks that require the learner to engage actively with the topic.\u00a0\n\n- UNIT 0 \u2013 Kick-off meeting and skills assessment (suggested format: live online seminar): The goal is to introduce the course, its learning objectives and structure including assessment types (if applicable) and to answer all questions of the participants before they start the asynchronous learning journey. The second part of the kick-off meeting will include the self-assessment of participants\u2019 digital competencies using the Digital Competence Wheel.\n\n- UNIT 1 \u2013 Digital Project\no Exercise: Let your participants plan and implement their own blog, website or app (for advanced students), which they will operate over the whole period of the course (for 9 weeks). Each week they have to reflect on their learning creating a blog post, website entry or app feature. Let participants become creative and provide them with some ideas and inspiration, as well as useful (open source) software upfront:\n(1) Project Management, Process mapping, idea sketching and brainstorming: Trello, XMind\n(2) Blog/Website (no HTML skills necessary) for beginner level: Wix, Jimdo, Weebly\n(3) App (no programming skills necessary) for intermediate level or above: GoodBarber, Swiftic, AppYourself, Shoutem, Openasapp\n(4) App (free but programming skills necessary) for advanced level only: Visual Studio by Microsoft\n\n- UNIT 2 \u2013 Information\no Exercise: Let participants do a little research on the Internet about \u201cwhat are digital skills\u201d. Participants must store and organize this data and share it with one of their peers. The peer evaluates the relevance and purpose of the collected data and how it has been organized and stored. Different supporting tools are allowed and can be introduced, e.g. Citavi, Mendeley, Google Scholar, digital libraries (EBSCO, J-Store etc.), clouds (dropbox, wetransfer, etc.), formats (PDF, JPEG, etc.), other software and tools etc. before the exercise or after.\n\n- UNIT 3 - Communication\no Exercise: Participants will do a group work online about \u201cSocial Media and Communication\u201d and give an online presentation. The exercise is based on a peer evaluation according to the following crucial criteria: online collaboration (type and interactivity), digital content (visualization, systems, applications), use of technology and media choice.\n\n- UNIT 4 \u2013 Digital Content Production\no Exercise: Participants will create a podcast, screencast, video or interactive images in groups. Tools and software programs can be introduced before the exercise to provide support (suggested for beginner level) or not, so that students can discover them in a self-paced manner (suggested for intermediate and higher level).\n\n- UNIT 5 \u2013 Safety (decide on one of the two exercises or the experiment)\no Exercise A: Participants follow the digital footprint of one of their peers and share what can be found on the internet about their peer.\no Experiment: Participants practice social media detox for one week and reflect on their experiences, drawing out positive and negative experiences, as well as opportunities and threats.\no Exercise B: Participants track their screen time for a week and see how many hours they spend online and what they do with this time. Afterwards, let them compare this with peers. In the end, let participants check the \u201cDigital Wellness\u201d functions of their devices and choose suitable settings for their own needs.\n\n- UNIT 6 \u2013 Artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and games (suggested for intermediate or higher proficiency level)\no Exercise: Give your participants the task to experiment with augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and games. They can work alone, in pairs, or groups. They must share the experiences they have made (in any format they like, e.g. personal meeting and discussion, sharing a video or ppt) with at least one of their peers and compare their peers\u2019 experiences with their own experiences. Some examples are given here (let participants choose from the list or bring in their own ideas):\n(a) Go to the local consumer electronics store and try out virtual glasses! Sometimes also museums or other attractions use VR glasses, look at your local museum\u2019s homepage to find out more.\n(b) Observe your cleaning robot (or go to your friends who have one) and try to find out the underlying system, technology, and logic it cleans your home.\n(c) Try out a virtual reality game (or do some research about it). Have a look at the following Educational VR games (Tip: you can also try it out with your younger siblings or children).\n(d) Try out ChatGPT and do some research about this AI software developed by OpenAI (New York Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html)\nQuestions to answer for participants:\u00a0\n(1) Is it a first-time experience for you? What is it like? Did you enjoy it or not? Why?\n(2) Would you buy/use such a product/service? Why/why not?\n(3) Explain the underlying system, technologies and logic that are used!\n(4) Do some further research about the related risks and challenges!\n\n- UNIT 7 \u2013 Final Assessment\no Final Assignment: In order to obtain a certificate of completion, students have to complete all exercises and write a weekly blog post (website entry, app) (see Unit 1) where they submit the exercises and describe their learnings in the course.\n\n- EXTRA UNIT \u2013 Social networks (for intermediate or higher proficiency levels)\no Exercise A: Let participants look for a role model account that they like and follow on a social network (preferably: Twitter, Xing, or LinkedIn). Participants have to draw out the strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats (let them do a SWOT analysis!) related to the chosen account and based on that analysis they should update their existing accounts.\u00a0\no Exercise B (extension to Unit 5): Let participants read this New York Times Article Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout so Far (2018).

Let participants become creative and provide them with some ideas and inspiration, as well as useful (open source) software upfront:\n(1) Project Management, Process mapping, idea sketching and brainstorming: Trello, XMind\n(2) Blog/Website (no HTML skills necessary) for beginner level: Wix, Jimdo, Weebly\n(3) App (no programming skills necessary) for intermediate level or above: GoodBarber, Swiftic, AppYourself, Shoutem, Openasapp\n(4) App (free but programming skills necessary) for advanced level only: Visual Studio by Microsoft\n\n- UNIT 2 \u2013 Information\no Exercise: Let participants do a little research on the Internet about \u201cwhat are digital skills\u201d. Participants must store and organize this data and share it with one of their peers. The peer evaluates the relevance and purpose of the collected data and how it has been organized and stored. Different supporting tools are allowed and can be introduced, e.g. Citavi, Mendeley, Google Scholar, digital libraries (EBSCO, J-Store etc.), clouds (dropbox, wetransfer, etc.), formats (PDF, JPEG, etc.), other software and tools etc. before the exercise or after.\n\n- UNIT 3 - Communication\no Exercise: Participants will do a group work online about \u201cSocial Media and Communication\u201d and give an online presentation. The exercise is based on a peer evaluation according to the following crucial criteria: online collaboration (type and interactivity), digital content (visualization, systems, applications), use of technology and media choice.\n\n- UNIT 4 \u2013 Digital Content Production\no Exercise: Participants will create a podcast, screencast, video or interactive images in groups. Tools and software programs can be introduced before the exercise to provide support (suggested for beginner level) or not, so that students can discover them in a self-paced manner (suggested for intermediate and higher level).\n\n- UNIT 5 \u2013 Safety (decide on one of the two exercises or the experiment)\no Exercise A: Participants follow the digital footprint of one of their peers and share what can be found on the internet about their peer.\no Experiment: Participants practice social media detox for one week and reflect on their experiences, drawing out positive and negative experiences, as well as opportunities and threats.\no Exercise B: Participants track their screen time for a week and see how many hours they spend online and what they do with this time. Afterwards, let them compare this with peers. In the end, let participants check the \u201cDigital Wellness\u201d functions of their devices and choose suitable settings for their own needs.\n\n- UNIT 6 \u2013 Artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and games (suggested for intermediate or higher proficiency level)\no Exercise: Give your participants the task to experiment with augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and games. They can work alone, in pairs, or groups. They must share the experiences they have made (in any format they like, e.g. personal meeting and discussion, sharing a video or ppt) with at least one of their peers and compare their peers\u2019 experiences with their own experiences. Some examples are given here (let participants choose from the list or bring in their own ideas):\n(a) Go to the local consumer electronics store and try out virtual glasses! Sometimes also museums or other attractions use VR glasses, look at your local museum\u2019s homepage to find out more.\n(b) Observe your cleaning robot (or go to your friends who have one) and try to find out the underlying system, technology, and logic it cleans your home.\n(c) Try out a virtual reality game (or do some research about it). Have a look at the following Educational VR games (Tip: you can also try it out with your younger siblings or children).\n(d) Try out ChatGPT and do some research about this AI software developed by OpenAI (New York Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html)\nQuestions to answer for participants:\u00a0\n(1) Is it a first-time experience for you? What is it like? Did you enjoy it or not? Why?\n(2) Would you buy/use such a product/service? Why/why not?\n(3) Explain the underlying system, technologies and logic that are used!\n(4) Do some further research about the related risks and challenges!\n\n- UNIT 7 \u2013 Final Assessment\no Final Assignment: In order to obtain a certificate of completion, students have to complete all exercises and write a weekly blog post (website entry, app) (see Unit 1) where they submit the exercises and describe their learnings in the course.\n\n- EXTRA UNIT \u2013 Social networks (for intermediate or higher proficiency levels)\no Exercise A: Let participants look for a role model account that they like and follow on a social network (preferably: Twitter, Xing, or LinkedIn). Participants have to draw out the strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats (let them do a SWOT analysis!) related to the chosen account and based on that analysis they should update their existing accounts.\u00a0\no Exercise B (extension to Unit 5): Let participants read this New York Times Article Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout so Far (2018).

These digital certificates can be shared via social media and are used to validate acquired competencies in front of potential employers or clients. MCI developed the Digital Badge Program and offers a range of badges to MCI students (independently of graduation level and study program), who have collected experience and additional qualifications by engaging in extracurricular activities in different ambits and fields. Thus, in addition to their regular studies, students enjoy the freedom to select badges according to their individual preferences, personal interests, and individual career plans to develop themselves further. In this way, students not only learn digital skills and become familiar with lifelong learning but can also create a unique career portfolio (MCI, 2022).", "assessment": "To obtain a certificate of completion (e.g., digital badge), students have to complete all exercises and write a weekly blog post where they submit the exercises and describe their learnings in the course.\u00a0", "supervision_of_assessment": "Supervised online or onsite with identity verification.", "quality_assurance": "This course is based on a course by Regina Obexer, Senior Lecturer at MCI | The Entrepreneurial School\u00ae, Innsbruck (Austria), who provided the idea and materials for this module and supported the development of the EICAA Competence Development Kit.\u00a0\nThe original idea for this module is based on the University of Edinburgh\u2019s 23 Things Program available at https://www.23things.ed.ac.uk/ (with per-mission from Stephanie (Charlie) Farley).\u00a0", "format": "1.

It includes an e-lecture (90 min) and self-paced online sessions (8 teaching units). The course stretches along 9 weeks:\n- Kick-Off online seminar (90 min): introduction with the instructor (course overview, learning outcomes, assessments, etc.).\n- Asynchronous online learning (for 9 weeks): activation of a digital learning platform for the participants. Learners are advised to spend about 60 minutes each week to complete the given tasks. Participants can work through the contents on their own and in their own learning rhythm within the given period.\u00a0", "instructor_manual_": "INFORMATION & PREPARATION FOR THE EDUCATOR/TRAINER:\nThis module introduces a range of tools and topics relevant to digital skills development, with a focus on their application in participants\u2019 academic and professional context. It covers the use of social media as well as tools for content creation, self-management, and self-development. Aspect such as digital well-being and online safety are also included.\nTo prepare course contents, refer to the Digital Competence Platform developed by the internet sociologist Anders Skov \u00a92016 Center for Digital Dannelse. This platform provides a lot of useful information and input for designing and implementing a course to foster digital competences. First, it provides an overview of the definition of digital competencies. Moreover, methodological and theoretical considerations to map digital skills with the Digital Competence Wheel are presented. We suggest using the Digital Competence Wheel to assess the competencies of the participants before and after the course. Finally, four areas of digital competencies are introduced (Skov, 2016):\n1. INFORMATION: identification, organization and analysis of digital information.\n2. COMMUNICATION: communication and interaction virtually.\n3. PRODUCTION: creation and editing of digital content.\n4. SAFETY: consideration of rights and duties, strengths and risks, opportunities and threats when working with ICT.\u00a0\nThese areas can serve as teaching blocks and a guide to structure the course, learning goals and content. We suggest a collaborative teaching and peer learning approach for this module.\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE:\nThis module is designed to expose participants to a range of digital tools and topics that are useful for participants\u2019 personal and professional development as a student and as a professional. After an introduction to the program (see Unit 0), participants will be spending about 60 minutes each week working through several tasks designed to encourage engagement with the tools and topics of that week and to reflect on how they could be useful in their own context. New content, tasks and further information are released each week on a digital learning platform, and participants get an email reminder to complete the tasks, which they can do at their own pace and in their own time.\nEach module consists of a short introduction to the topic with pertinent information, a small selection of links to further information, and a set of tasks that require the learner to engage actively with the topic.\u00a0\n\n- UNIT 0 \u2013 Kick-off meeting and skills assessment (suggested format: live online seminar): The goal is to introduce the course, its learning objectives and structure including assessment types (if applicable) and to answer all questions of the participants before they start the asynchronous learning journey.

Therefore, the way how to solve an exercise should not be determined, but participants will have to keep a diary where they write down what they have done to achieve the goals. The instructor can choose freely on which topic the participants should work. The idea is to realize a business idea. The instructor can give the participants a topic, e.g., \u201cGo green\u201d and let them come up with their own (community) initiative on how to make a small impact. Then, the participants should bring the idea into action. Therefore, we propose to work along the 4P marketing mix (product, place, price, promotion). However, participants need to take the initiative at each stage, e.g., create a reel, or a website to promote their event.\u00a0\nDepending on the proficiency level, more advanced concepts than the 4P Marketing Mix might be chosen. Outcomes could for instance be creating stickers to turn off lights when leaving a room (printing, selling, prompting them, giving them out in the community, recruiting partners that use the sticker). Other participants can create a TikTok dance to promote sustainability/ their workshop or their topic.\u00a0\n\nExercises and topics that can be used by the instructor:\u00a0\n- Organize workshop, e.g., Friday for Future\n- Start an initiative targeting the elderly, e.g., organize events where participants help out setting up cell phones or other digital advice for digital non-natives\n- Implement a social media campaign on e.g., Instagram (let them document the process of how they got followers).\n- Participating in a community run\n- Organizing a second-hand clothing market\n- Taking a sustainable initiative on campus or the workplace, e.g., organizing a clean-up day\u00a0\n- Organize a clean-up day in the community (e.g., trash and plastic reduction in nature nearby)\u00a0\n- Start a crowdfunding campaign for a topic named above\u00a0\n- Organize a first-aid workshop\u00a0\n\nIf the module is online, the topics to work on should be adapted to online content or the creation of an online event.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "No resources", "resources_for_participants": "No resources", "external/additional_material": "Miles (2022): Take the initiative: A how-to guide in 10 steps.

In particular, we work on the concept of failure. Failure is sometimes unavoidable in entrepreneurship and innovation because we are building something new that nobody has tried before. Far beyond its unavoidability, failure is a great source of learning, when we are able to look at failure with the appropriate mindset. However, mostly all of us were educated in educational settings and within a culture where failure was something \u201cbad\u201d, i.e., leading to negative consequences (imagine failing in an exam). Thus, too often our implicit approach to failure is to avoid it and in doing so, we also avoid trying out new things.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis module suggests activities in which the participants can experience failure and reflect on it.

An ideal activity could be the well-known \u201cspaghetti tower\u201d exercise.\n\nIn the spaghetti tower exercise, the participants are split up into teams of four or five members each. Each team is given 20 strands of uncooked spaghetti, one yard of masking tape, one yard of cotton string, and a marshmallow. The teams are instructed to build the tallest self-standing tower supporting the marshmallow at the top, using only the materials given. The team that is able to build the tallest tower wins the competition and gets a prize (e.g., a chocolate bar). The teams are given 18\u2019 for the task and after this time, they are not allowed to touch the tower anymore. The facilitator measures the height of the towers after they have been standing for 30s.\n\nThe exercise is often conducted as a team-building activity but can also be used to reflect on failures. One of the most common results of this exercise is that the teams first try to build the tallest tower and when the time is almost over, they place the marshmallow on top, which often makes the tower collapse. Time pressure and discussions among the team members on how to build the best structure often prevent the teams from getting good results.\n\n2 \u2013 Discussion and reflection\n\nAfter the exercise, the facilitator asks the participants to join in a discussion, by answering the following questions which go from the particular experience of the spaghetti tower to a more general reflection on the understanding of failure in their life/work:\n\n\nRelated to the particular experience of the spaghetti tower:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0What happened?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0How did you feel when the tower failed?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. What did you think when the tower failed?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0What are the consequences of failing?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.\u00a0\u00a0Why did you fail?\n\nThe facilitator needs to listen actively to the participants\u2019 contributions and if necessary, stretch their answers so that the participants can go deeper into their observations. For example, answers to question 2 might be around frustration towards oneself or towards other members of the same team, or envy towards other teams that succeeded. While answering question 3, the facilitator might notice negative thoughts about \u201cusing the wrong approach\u201d or the \u201cown incompetence of oneself or the team\u201d. Answers to question 5 might be around \u201cblaming others\u201d, \u201cblaming oneself\u201d, \u201ccomplaining about the lack of tools\u201d, or the \u201clack of proper explanations by the facilitator\u201d. The facilitator might notice these contributions and without resistance of defending himself might provide these observations back to the participants so that they are aware of their thoughts about failure.\n\nWithin a broader context:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. What did we learn about failure in school/from our parents/within our culture?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.\u00a0\u00a0What is the culture around failure in the organization/university?\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, the facilitator might expect that the school or the educational systems didn\u2019t provide the right context to learn how to deal with failure. An extract from Lanny (2019) might also contribute to this point of view, being this case related to teaching in science:\n\n\u201cHow often do we inadvertently discourage students from persisting in science, simply by omitting honest descriptions of the failure inherent to the research process? Research is messy and full of failed attempts. Trying to protect students from that reality does them a disservice.\u201d\n\nQuestion 7 is particularly interesting in organizational contexts because it allows the participants to reflect on how the organization responds to failure and how they confront failure when it happens, and also, whether they dare to try out new things or bring new ideas to the organization.\n\n\nAfter the discussion, each team is invited to think of a definition of failure for 5\u2019 and share it with the rest of the group. The facilitator can provide feedback and add nuances if necessary.\n\n3 \u2013 Failure in entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship\n\nThe instructor provides some examples of successful businesses or entrepreneurs which were preceded by some failures or rejections. Some well-known examples are:\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas Edison and his trials to invent the light bulb (Peek, 2022).\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jeff Bezos in Amazon Game Studios (Scipioni, 2021).\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter (Millington, 2018)\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GoPro Founder Nick Woodman (Stephanie, n.d.).\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0James Dyson and the Dual Cyclone vacuum cleaner (Goodman, 2012).\n\n\nAlso in science, some discoveries resulted from failed or unexpected results of experiments:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discovery of penicillin (American Chemical Society International Historic Chemical Landmarks, n.d.).\n\n\u00a0After providing these examples, the instructor asks the teams to choose a case of failure(s) (entrepreneur, business, scientist, artist\u2026) which finally resulted in positive outcomes. Every team chooses a different case, from those listed or another. The task consists of investigating the case, and building a story, supported by a visual that they draw or sketch related to the case and a slogan. Every team presents the case that they elaborated in a pitch of 2\u2019.\u00a0\n\n4 \u2013 My own failures in life\n\nNow the participants are asked to reflect individually on their past failures in life. Then, they are asked to choose one of these failures and write about what happened in that situation and the (negative) consequences of that failure. To do this, the participants can use the \u201cRetrospective Life Failure Card\u201d (side 1) that is provided with this module. The participants can fill out more than one card, one for each failure that they experienced in life.\u00a0\n\nThis exercise is about reflecting on past experiences. Systematic reflection (both from failures as well as from successes) has been proven useful for meaningful learning (Ellis et al., 2014).\n\n5 \u2013 Reframing\n\nNow the instructor introduces the role of cognition in the interpretation of failure and how our response to it is largely influenced by our thoughts. The facilitator can show how a given failure leads to different behavioural responses depending on the interpretation. For example, take failure number 215 of Dyson\u2019s tests on the Dual Cyclone vacuum cleaner and see the following example:\n\n##pictures/3.4::pictureB1.jpg##\n\nParticipants are invited to fill in other types of thoughts and reflect on the behavioural consequences of those.\n\n\u00a0This table is inspired by the model A-B-C of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) designed by Albert Ellis (1999), where:\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0A: activating event: a negative situation occurs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0B: Beliefs: the explanation we create for why the situation happened\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- C: Consequences: our feelings and behaviours in response to adversity, caused by our beliefs\n\nGiven this framework, participants are now invited to fill in side 2 of the \u201cRetrospective Life Failure Card\u201d, in which they are asked to think about the positive consequences of that failure (if any), and the learnings derived from it. After some minutes of personal reflection, participants are asked to share the exercise with a partner. By doing this, every participant enhances their learning while listening to others\u2019 stories and can gain a greater understanding of their own failures by receiving feedback from their partners.\u00a0\n\n6 \u2013 Closing\n\nThe last part of the session is structured as follows. First, the instructor asks the participants to think of how they can transfer the knowledge and learnings of the class to their work/study/life. Second, the instructor asks the participants to share briefly their takeaways for this session. Finally, she closes the session by summarising the contents and learnings of the lesson and adding additional nuances to the comments brought by the students.", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "American Chemical Society International Historic Chemical Landmarks (n.d.).

That\u2019s why it is important that would-be entrepreneurs learn about the concepts of risk and uncertainty and develop knowledge, competences and attitudes to cope with risk and uncertainty.\n\nIn this module, participants are asked to calculate the risk of a given scenario and to design strategies to minimize and cope with risk. The participants will also learn about their risk aversion or tolerance with a warm-up exercise.

(45\u2019)\n7. Closing (15\u2019)\n\n1. Warm-up: How much risk averse are you?\nParticipants are asked to play a game to know how much risk averse or risk tolerant they are. They are confronted with a list of ten decisions between two options: a risky one with known probabilities (Option A) and a safe one (Option B). In each of the ten cases option A corresponds to gaining \u20ac300 with a 50% chance or gaining \u20ac0 with a 50% chance. The safe option B on the other hand gradually increases from \u20ac25 to \u20ac250 (see table below). Every participant fills in the table. Then, the participants need to share with the hole group which was the flipping point for them. This can be done by writing every participant\u2019s flipping point in a post-it\n\nIt is expected that in the first options, the participants choose the risky option and at a certain point onwards, the participants choose the safe option. Risk-neutrality is implied in this setup by a switching point from Option A to Option B at the 6th decision (\u20ac150 for sure). Thus, participants with switching points before 6 are risk averse and participants with switching points after 6 are risk tolerant.\n\nThe facilitator categorises the post-its according in five categories: strong risk averse (options 1,2), risk averse (3-5), neutral (6), risk tolerant (7-8), strong risk tolerant (9-10).\n\n##pictures/3.4::pictureI1.png##\n\nThe facilitator can simulate the game by flipping a coin 10 times and asking every participant to calculate their payoffs and evaluate, in average, what the best strategy could be. Then, the facilitator can invite the participants to discuss why the 6th choice is the neutral point for risk aversion. The instructor can also ask some of the participants to explain their strategies for this exercise and whether their choices in this exercise are connected to how much risk averse or risk tolerant they behave in life.\n\nTo close this warm-up, the facilitator can introduce the concept of risk aversion. According to Koudstaal et al (2020), risk aversion is the willingness of people to sacrifice expected payoffs to circumvent taking risks. In other words, it measures the extent to which the utility of a guaranteed payoff (for instance 150) is higher than the utility derived from a proposition with the same expected reward obtained with risk (for instance 300 with 50% probability and 0 with 50% probability). Risk aversion is involved in decision making situations where a probability can be assigned to each possible outcome of the situation (Koudstall et al, 2000, pp. 5-6).\n\nThis experiment is used in Koudstaal et al (2000) and Holt & Laury (2002) to evaluate risk attitudes of entrepreneurs versus non-entrepreneurs.\n\n2. Risk and uncertainty\nThe facilitator explains the difference between risk and uncertainty. She can refer to the early definitions by Knight (1921) on two types of uncertainty:\nA: Measurable uncertainty: this refers to a situation where we can calculate a priori probabilities of outcomes.\nB: Unmeasurable uncertainty: this refers to a situation where we cannot calculate the probabilities of possible outcomes.\u00a0\n\nThe first type of uncertainty is commonly referred as \u201crisk\u201d, or \u201cKnightian risk\u201d, while the second type of uncertainty is referred simply as \u201cuncertainty\u201d. Then, the facilitator asks the participants to redesign the previous experiment so that the players are faced with uncertainty rather than risk.\n\nOne of the answers for this could be that the players do not know the probability of Option A. Thus, they need to choose between A and B without this information. Another potential answer to this question would be a table where the participant needs to choose between option A without knowing the payoff amounts or without knowing which option (A or B) is the risky option and the safe option.\n\nKahneman and Tversky\u2019s (1982) suggested that there are two types of uncertainty, internal and external. The former relates to factors of the external environment that the decision-maker is not able to control. The latter refers to a lack of knowledge imputable to factors that are proper to the decision-maker.\u00a0\n\n3. Hands-on activity\nThe participants are asked to sit in teams of four members. Every team is given a scenario to work with, such as a business situation, taking a trip, an early startup, organising an event such as a concert, etc. The steps of the activity are as follows:\n\n\u00a01. Every team needs to identify and list all the possible risks associated with that scenario.\n\n\u00a02. Then, the participants are asked to calculate the probability or likelihood of occurrence and the\u00a0\u00a0potential impact (negative result) of every risk. Participants can use a template (risk assessment worksheet), as the one provided below.\n\n\u00a03. For financial risks, participants can use a formula to calculate the financial risk: Risk= probability of loss * potential loss.\n\u00a0\n4. Then, every team needs to prioritize the risks, according to the probability of occurrence and degree of impact. If prioritization is difficult, participants can use a two-dimensional plot to draw the risks and decide on the most important ones. The x axis of this plot is the likelihood of occurrence, and the y axis is the degree of negative impact (the higher the y value, the higher negative impact). Those risks at the top right of the plot would be ones that should be prioritized.\n\n5. Select the most important risks and write strategies to minimize the risks and cope with them if they occur.\n\n4. Wrap-up\nEvery team pitches their findings and insights in front of the rest of participants.\n\n5. Strategies for risk management\nThe facilitator recapitulates what has been shared in the session and emphasizes the relevance of conducting risk management in any project. Risk management involves the identification of risks, the evaluation of risks, their minimisation and/or prevention and finally, risk monitoring. The first three phases of this process have been illustrated in the previous activity.\u00a0\n\nThe facilitator can introduce these phases and the strategies associated with each of these phases:\n1. Risk identification. Strategies: brainstorming, interviews, \u201cwhat if\u201d questions, scenario analysis.\n2. Risk assessment: estimation of likelihood of occurrence and impact.\n3. Risk response: avoiding and preventing risks. Minimisation of risks.\n4. Risk monitoring: designing and implementing a plan for risk monitoring, risks reactivation and reconsideration of previously minimised risks.\n\nThe facilitator can use the paper by Rosu et al. (2017) to elaborate on this and/or allow the participants read the paper and hold a discussion.\n\n6. Are entrepreneurs more risk tolerant?\nThe aim of the final part of the session is to discuss with participants whether entrepreneurs are more risk tolerant than the general population. The common perception is that entrepreneurs are more risk tolerant, that is, they are willing to take more risks than non-entrepreneurs. However, re-search on this topic has found no evidence (or inconclusive findings). Sharing these findings with participants is relevant to provide alternative perspectives on the issue and also to convey the message that an individual does not need to be risk tolerant to start up new ventures. Thus, rather than focusing on personality traits that make an entrepreneur willing to tackle risks, we should focus on what strategies can be used to identify, minimise and deal with risks. Entrepreneurs use predictive or control strate-gies to tackle uncertainty and risk (see Module 3.4.\"Coping with Uncertainty, Management and Risk\u201d \u2013 Advanced).\n\nSeveral references that can be used by the facilitator are: Magnani & Zucchella (2018), Li & Ahlstrom (2020), Charness et al. (2020).\n\n7.

Predicting strategies try to estimate potential outcomes and their probabilities, often combined with techniques to reduce those uncertainties by expanding knowledge.

Scenario\u00a0\n\nImagine that you and some colleagues are very passionate about analog photography (also named film photography). One day, while having a coffee with your colleagues, you come up with the idea of organising a gathering with other people who also like film photography as a hobby. This is the first time that such a gathering takes place in your city and although you know other people who also like film photography, you are not members of any network yet. Precisely, one of the goals of this gathering is to do networking with other people and learn from each other.\u00a0\n\nThe gathering would be held in your city, since you believe it can attract much pictorical interest and it would last for two days. You would like to invite a famous film photographer to give an inspirational talk, run a series of workshops, networking sessions, and a competition of pictures of your city, with the topic \u201cHidden places\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIn your initial conversations, you and your colleagues are very much aware of the risk of organising this meeting and you start worrying whether you should go for it or you should desist. However, you feel very passionate about it and you know that it might be the right moment to organise this meeting, given the rise of interest in analog photography. You also think that if you are successful, you can get some extra money to build a professional studio an even, constitute a society of \u201curban film photographers\u201d.\u00a0\n\n2. Predicting the Net Present Value (NPV) - An introduction\u00a0\n\nThe Net Present Value is an estimation of the net value of an activity or project. You calculate the money that you expect to get at a given future time, translate it into today\u2019s euros or dollars and compare it with your current investment. Thus, you can estimate if your project is worthwhile.\u00a0\n\nTo do this, it requires an estimation of your demand for the project or idea, subject to some price assumptions. Then, you also need to calculate the costs of your activities. You should also assess the variability in the forecast, which might give large margins of error in your estimation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTo calculate the NPV of your idea, you need to answer some questions:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0What is your estimated demand (number of attendees)?\u00a0\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0What is the price for attending the meeting?\u00a0\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0What are your costs?\u00a0\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0What are your intended overheads?\u00a0\n\n3. Calculate your NPV - Activity\u00a0\n\nGiven this introduction, the students are split in groups of 3 or 4 members and are asked to make an estimation of NPV, based on the following costs:\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venue (0-100 participants): 10,000 EUR\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invited speaker: 5,000 EUR\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Competition: 3,000 EUR\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meals and coffee breaks: 120 EUR x participant x day\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Administrative costs: 5,000 EUR\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marketing and promotion: 5,000 EUR\n\nThe students need to set the price for attendance and estimate a number of participants. They can use a spreadsheet and parametrise these values to get different estimates, i.e., a worst-case scenario, an optimistic scenario and a neutral one.\u00a0\n\n4. Reflection\u00a0\n\nEvery team briefly shares their estimations with the whole group. The facilitator or a volunteer participant can write them down in a flipchart. Then, the facilitator can invite the students to reflect on the exercise, to make them aware of the uncertainty that is behind these estimations. Some potential questions for discussion are:\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0What were your thoughts during the exercise?\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0How did you feel when you were doing the estimation?\u00a0\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0Did you agree easily on the estimations within your team?\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0Was it a difficult exercise? Why?\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0Why do you think there is a high variability of your estimations among the different teams?\u00a0\n\nAfter the reflection, the facilitator can wrap up:\u00a0\n\nNPV is useful to make financial forecasts for your entrepreneurial idea, but there is a large uncertainty regarding the number of attendees that you can get when you organise this gathering, find a good estimation for the price, and also to what degree the potential attendees will be sensitive to the price. Since you don\u2019t have experience in organising such events and you are not part of an existing network, you are facing a large uncertainty. Other unexpected events might be also influencing your entrepreneurial idea, such as other similar events being organised by other people (e.g., potential competitors).\u00a0\n\nResearch on personal responses to uncertainty found evidence that uncertainty triggers emotions of fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, frustration and confusion, especially when the outcomes might be negative (Morris et al., 2022).\u00a0\n\n5. Introduction to Prediction strategies vs. Control Strategies\u00a0\n\nThe strategy taken to decide whether to pursue or not the opportunity is based on predicting the potential returns.\u00a0\u00a0When entrepreneurs are faced with uncertainties, there are two types of strategies: prediction-based strategies and control-based strategies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrediction-based strategies, as we have seen, focus on estimating unknowns while\ncontrol-based strategies focus on shaping unknowns via proactive behaviour. As follows, we introduce the concept of affordable loss within the framework of effectuation, to introduce the students to an alternative way of taking decisions under conditions of uncertainty.\u00a0\n\nInstead of deciding whether to pursue an opportunity based on potential returns, the effectuation principle looks at potential losses. Thus, the decision is made on the downside risk that is acceptable rather than on what returns might be. Thus, rather than calculating how much investment the entrepreneurs need to develop the idea (financial and non-financial, such as time and effort), entrepreneurs decide how much they are willing to lose. In other words, the affordable loss principle tells us to evaluate opportunities based on whether the downside is acceptable, rather than on the attractiveness of the predicted upside.\u00a0\n\n6. Estimate your affordable losses \u2013 Activity\u00a0\n\nFollowing the effectuation principles, the participants are asked to use a control strategy, following these steps:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a01. Considering the \u201cBird in the hand\u201d principle, reconsider how much you need to start the initiative. The less you need, the less you need to worry. Thus, be creative and think of alternative possibilities to reduce the costs. This might imply to change the original idea so that you can start with you own means, as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a02. Calculate the affordable loss. For that, you need to address the question of what downside risk is affordable to you: what you can afford to lose and what you are willing to lose. Consider the resources you need to invest in this new venture and how much you are willing to accept as a loss. Within resources, you can consider money (your own\u2019s or borrowed money from family and friends), time, effort, etc. Once you have done that, considering all the members of the team, this will set a threshold, which will help you take the final decision whether to pursue or not the idea.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a03. Get stakeholders on board. The Crazy quilt\u202fprinciple emphasizes the value of collaborating with various types of partners who are willing to commit, rather than searching for potential partners who might not be available or motivated. Effectual entrepreneurs search partnerships with people and organisations willing to make a real commitment to jointly creating the initiative with them. This enhances the loses you can afford and you can co-create a revise concept of the original idea. Thus, imagine that you can get a new stakeholder (company, association, well-known photographer) and revise your affordable losses and the concept itself. To do this, one or two members of the team roleplay as this potential stakeholder and you need to agree on the new concept. Once you have done that, you\u2019ll get a new estimation of the affordable losses and this will help to take the decision on whether to pursue the initiative and\u00a0\u00a0how the initiative will be implemented.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a04. Prepare a pitch where you need to explain the final concept for the gathering. Also, include in the pitch deck the process that you followed using the prediction and control strategies and the learnings that you take from it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n7. Pitches\u00a0\n\nThe participant teams pitch their presentations, focusing on: the original initiative, how the initiative looks like after applying the effectuation principles, and their final decisions whether to pursue or not the idea and how.\u00a0\n\n8. Reflection\u00a0\n\nThe facilitator invites the participants to reflect on the general takeaways on the activity. Here are some potential questions to foster discussion:\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0What kind of uncertainties did you face during this exercise?\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0What strategies for tackling uncertainties did you use?\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0What are the main differences between prediction and control strategies?\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0In which cases or situations a prediction strategy can work best? And a control strategy?\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0How did you manage with uncertainty, both at the personal and team level?\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0Where did you experience greater uncertainty and why?\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0How do you feel regarding uncertainty after the session?\u00a0\n\nIf the group is too large to handle such a discussion in the whole group, the facilitator can ask the participants to answer to these questions within the teams.\u00a0", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "Greco, V., & Roger, D.

It is also often referred as a minimum viable product (MVP).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0A prototype should contain the essential features of a product that allow for idea testing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0A prototype does not need to be a perfect product. It is better to prioritize readiness to show the product/service to customers than a better finished product that would need larger investment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0A prototype can also validate the willingness of the user to pay for it (e.g., through a landing page).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0- Prototypes can be built iteratively, by progressively adding new features as long as new information is gathered from these tests.\u00a0\n\n\nQuote for inspiration:\u00a0\n\n\"If You're Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You\u2019ve Launched Too Late\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn (cited in Saint, 2009)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2 \u2013 Quick brainstorming (20\u2019)\u00a0\n\nThe participants are invited to group in teams of 3-4 people and design a new product or service. If the teams already are working on some project ideas, they can choose that project for prototyping. Otherwise, they can choose a topic by brainstorming several ideas quickly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSome inspirational inputs that the instructor can provide are:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Bike repair service\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Kindergarden in the weekends\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBabysitters that teach\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0The travel agency for the elder\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0City tours\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Dog babysitting company\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Personal trainer\u00a0\n\n\n3 \u2013 Design the offer (20\u2019)\u00a0\n\nOnce every team has chosen the idea, they should design the offer. For that, they should:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Identify the need or problem they are trying to solve\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Design the offer that solves this need\u00a0\n\n\n4 \u2013 Building the prototype (1h 30\u2019)\u00a0\n\nThe instructor asks the participants to build a landing page as a prototype for the idea. The landing page usually serves to get the attention of the user and test how they perceive the offer. Landing pages usually incorporate a call to action for the user, such as providing the email to get more information, ordering the offer, making a preorder, downloading a free ebook or registering for an event. Landing pages are also useful to track the number of visitors and the actions they do using web site analytics.\u00a0\n\nThe instructor can give the following instructions to the students:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Contents of the landing page:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Appealing title (and subtitle) that describes your offer or your benefit in a short sentence to get the users\u2019 attention\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Features of the offer\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Benefits for the user\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Who you are (members of the entrepreneurial team)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Call to action to the user\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Questions to identify the features of the offer that should be highlighted:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- What are the essential features of the product/service?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- What is your unique selling proposition?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- What must be included to explain clearly what your product is about?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Design of the landing page:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- The landing page should have a nice design, i.e., it should seem professional without\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0much effort.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- A logo should be included, as well as appealing images that represent your business idea.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0- Tools:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0To build the landing page, students can use wix\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0For free images: Unsplash, Pixabay, or Pexels.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0To get inspiration for logos: fiverr, looka.\u00a0\n\nAfter this introduction, the students are given 1h 15\u2019 to work on their prototypes.\u00a0\n\n\n5 \u2013 Feedback session (1h)\u00a0\n\nIn this part of the session, every team needs to provide feedback to another team. All teams share the links to the landing pages. Then, the instructor randomly assigns to every team another team\u2019s landing page.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFeedback can be structured along these lines:\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Title and subtitle: do they capture the user\u2019s attention?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Are the features of that offer (unique selling point) clearly stated?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0- Design of the landing page: professional outlook, structure, clarity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Logo design and suitability of the design to the offer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0- What did you like most of the offer?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- If you were a potential customer, would you be interested in that offer? Would you follow the call to action? Why? Why not?\u00a0\n\n\nThe instructor gives 15\u2019 to each team to prepare the feedback. Then, every team shares the feedback aloud with the group. The instructor may add nuances and complementary points when needed.\u00a0\n\nThe feedback session is relevant for learning, because every team has the opportunity to evaluate another team\u2019s work, learn from it, and provide useful comments. At the same time, teams receive other points of views on their work and can see how their proposal can be perceived by customers and other stakeholders.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a06 \u2013 Wrap-Up (20\u2019)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The instructor asks the participants to reflect on the benefits of prototyping. A list of benefits highlighted by Voigt (2022) is:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0See in real time how viable your product is\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Understand potential go-to-market issues upfront, such as cost, time for development, or materials\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Gather feedback from internal stakeholders and customers\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Test out new ideas that may not be in the market currently\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Get buy-in and support from investors and mentors\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFinally, the instructor asks every participant to reflect on the takeaways of the session:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What did I learn today?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "References:\n\u00a0\nSaint, N.

Part two includes all the activities associated with selling something: finding and reaching customers, transacting a sale, distributing the product, or delivering the service. A new business model may turn on\u202fdesigning a new product\u202ffor an unmet need or on a process innovation. -Joan Magretta\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA set of assumptions or hypotheses\u201d - Alex Osterwalder. His nine-part \u201cbusiness model canvas\u201d is essentially an organized way to lay out your assumptions about not only the key resources and key activities of your value chain, but also your value proposition, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structures, and revenue streams\u202f\u2014 to see if you\u2019ve missed anything important and to compare your model to others.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAssumptions about what a company gets paid for\u201d \u2013 Peter Drucker (HBR)\u00a0\n\nThe instructors listens to the answers and leads the discussion to the point of view of the BMC as a set of hypotheses that need to be tested. The instructor can relate this point of view to the uncertainties that the participants faced while they were designing their offer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Thus, if the BMC can be seen as a set of assumptions that need to be tested, we can relate to the scientific method as a way of testing these assumptions:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Identifying hypothesis\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Designing experiments\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Running the tests\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Gaining insights\u00a0\n\nHerein, the instructor can explain the Design Loop and the Test Loop (see picture). In the Test Loop, we identify hypotheses, we design and run experiments and we learn from them. These learnings are then used in decision making: whether the idea needs to be adapted/refined/changed, discarded or kept. In the later case, the entrepreneurs might proceed with the next step of tests.\u00a0\n\n##pictures/3.5::pictureI1.jpg##\n\n3. Let\u2019s become scientist entrepreneurs! Identify your hypotheses (20\u2019)\u00a0\n\nNext, the instructor provides the next instructions for the participants:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Write down all the hypotheses that you can come up related to Customer, Value proposition, Revenue streams or other dimensions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Prioritise and choose one or two hypotheses that you think you should test first.\u00a0\n\n4. Let\u2019s become scientist entrepreneurs! Design your experiments (40\u2019)\u00a0\n\nThe instructor asks the students to pick one hypotheses (maximum two) and design at least one experiment for each. Experiments need to be designed to provide answers to the stated hypotheses. Since this part of the exercise is run in the session, interviewing can be the most common and practical technique. However, the instructor can also encourage the participants to design other experiments beyond interviewing customers.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the design of an experiment, the students are given the following instructions:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Decide how you will run the experiment (e.g., if interviews, prepare the interview)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Decide what you will measure.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Use the Test Card, designed by Strategizer (attached).\u00a0\n\n##pictures/3.5::pictureI2.jpg##\n\n5. Run the experiments (30\u2019)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The participants are given 30\u2019 to run the experiments within the session. This would mean that the students might split in small teams of interviewers and reach as many potential customers as they can. The participants are invited to wander around the class and find potential customers who they might interview.\u00a0\n\n6. Learn (30\u2019)\u00a0\n\nThe students are invited to sit again with their teams and share the insights that they got during the interviews. Then, they are asked to synthetize their insights in the Learning Card:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Analyse the evidence gathered by the team.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Write down your learnings\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Use the Learning Card, designed by Strategizer (fill in boxes \u201cWe believed that\u201d, \u201cWe observed\u201d, \u201cWe learned that\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n##pictures/3.5::pictureI3.jpg##\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0Decide (15\u2019)\u00a0\n\nBased on the learnings, the students are invited to decide on the next steps for the offer:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Persevere:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Continue testing the idea based on evidence and insights.

Meta-Learning & Learning Transfer (15\u2019)\u00a0\n\nThe instructor asks the participants to reflect on the learnings of the session. These allows the students to gain a general understanding of what they did in the session and how they can apply the learnings to other ideas and projects that they are working on.\u00a0\n\n\nTo guide thought, participants can use the Meta-Learning Card (attached).\n\n##pictures/3.5::pictureI4.jpg##", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "References:\n\nBland, D.J. & Osterwalder, A.

This module introduces a technique for Design named Co-creation. Co-creation goes beyond techniques such as Design Thinking by allowing customers and other stakeholders to participate and become active contributors in the design process. In Design Thinking, the designers empathise with the customers or users, but they are not necessarily part of the design process. Co-creation techniques, on the contrary, engage the users and other stakeholders (e.g., experts, service providers\u2026) as part of the design team.

For this purpose, face-to-face interactions are the preferred choice.\n\nThe module can be taught by an instructor. The ideal number of participants would range from 15 to 20, so that all participants can take an active involvement in the discussions. For the implementation of the co-creation sessions, it is recommended that there is an expert facilitator for each team, and she could be part of the co-creation team herself.\n\nThe sessions should be spaced at least one week, so that the core team of designers can wrap up the results of the previous session and prepare the next session.\n\nSTRUCTURE OF SESSIONS:\nSESSION 1 - Design of the co-creation process (4h)\nSESSION 2 - Co-creation session 1 \u2013 Problem identification (4h)\nSESSION 3 - Co-creation session 2 \u2013 Co-Design (4h)\nSESSION 4 - Co-creation session 3 \u2013 Validation (4h)\nSESSION 5 - Insights and conclusions (2h)", "instructor_manual_": "Session 1 - Design of the co-creation process\n\nThis session introduces the participants to the process of co-creation and its differences with Design Thinking. Then, the participants are asked to choose a service that they would like to create, and then draw the co-creation process that would lead to the design of that service.\u00a0\nThe participants will practice the implementation of the co-creation process on the ser-vice selected, ideally by inviting stakeholders (including customers or users) to participate as active members of the co-creation process. If this is not feasible, then the participants can roleplay some of the stakeholders.\n\n1.1. Introduction to Co-Creation\n\nThe facilitator introduces the concept of co-creation and co-design and its main differences from the well-known design thinking approach.\n\nSanders and Stappers provide a definition for the terms co-creation and co-design:\nThe authors take co-creation to refer to any act of collective creativity, i.e. creativity that is shared by two or more people. Co-creation is a very broad term with applications ranging from the physical to the metaphysical and from the material to the spiritual, as can be seen by the output of search engines. By co-design we indicate collective creativity as it is applied across the whole span of a design process, as was intended by the name of this journal. Thus, co-design is a specific instance of co-creation. Co-design refers, for some people, to the collective creativity of collaborating designers. We use co-design in a broader sense to refer to the creativity of designers and people not trained in design working together in the design development process (Sanders&Stappers, 2008, p.3).\n\n\nIn this module, we apply the principles of collective creation of a service by designers and non-designers and thus, we might be closer to the term co-design. In any case, in the last decades, the creation of products and services has been shifted from a product-centric view to personalised consumer experiences. As quoted in Sanders & Stappers (2008), \u201cinformed, networked, empowered and active consumers are increasingly co-creating value with the firm\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the classical approach of design thinking, the designers investigate the user\u2019s experience, and then design products and services that respond to the observed needs. In co-creation, the users and other stakeholders take part of the design process themselves. The consumers not only report on their experiences but also design the solution together with the rest of the team.\u00a0\n\n\n##pictures/3.5::pictureA1.png##\n\nFigure 1. Classical and co-design approaches to design (Sanders&Stappers, 2008, p.11)\n\n1.2. Choose a service\nThe participants are invited to choose a problem or domain where a service could be designed or improved. It is important that this service is within the hands of the team and that they can identify potential stakeholders who can take part of the process. If the service is something that is relevant to the organisation or university, the participants will find it more motivating and accessible. Examples of problems can be:\n- Redesign the bar/cantine of the university/organisation\n- Redesign the reception service of the university/organisation\n- Design an app to inform the users (e.g., timetables, events held at the universi-ty/organisation\u2026)\n- Improve the student\u2019s experience related to exams\n- Improve the communication between departments\n\nOther examples that would go beyond the existing environment of the university/organisation could be thought of. In such cases, the co-creation processes could be held by using a challenge suggested by a company or organisation and the co-creation process could be organised as a bootcamp, with participation of the different stakeholders. Some typical examples would be designing apps for health applications.\n- Design an app to help people reduce alcohol consumption\u00a0\n- Design an app to help reduce smoking\n\n1.3. Design the Co-creation process\nOnce the topic is decided, the participants need to design the co-creation process in detail. The design will be reviewed by the facilitator who will provide feedback.\n\nCore team:\n- Identify the members of the core team. The core co-creation team are the participants of the team that promote the design of the service.\n- Each member of the core team can take a different role or changing roles along the process. Some of the roles are: project leader, documentation, relations with stakeholders, resources responsible, etc.\n- Decide how you will organise the role of each member and the associated tasks.\n\nStakeholders:\n1. Identify the stakeholders: identify the customers, users, and the stakeholders that are related to the service. This might include current service providers, experts, developers, etc. For example, in the design of a health application, stake-holders could include the patients, the patients\u2019 relatives, doctors, medical per-sonnel, pharmaceutical companies, application designers, developers, etc.\n2. Think how you will reach these stakeholders, e.g., by email, through social networks, by direct call, through your network, etc. Organise the task of onboarding stakeholders among the team members.\n3. Prepare a short slidedoc to inform your stakeholders about the goal of the co-creation session and the value that they are expected to provide.\n\nOutline of the sessions:\nPrepare the outline of the sessions of co-creation:\n- Session 1: In the first session, the participants contribute by reflecting on current issues of related services, needs or difficulties they are facing related to the service (or lack of service). After the session, the core team of designers (the team of participants of the course) prepares a summary and shares it with the co-creation team.\n- Session 2: the co-creation team reviews the conclusions of the first session and design a service (or an improved service) that resonates with the customers/users. The results of the session is the design of the service. After the session, the core team of designers refines the design according to the contribution of the stakeholders. If there are compromising views, the core team takes decisions.\n- Session 3: the core team presents the final design of the service and designs a set of activities to test the design with the stakeholders and get feedback from them. A refined service is finally devised by the core team and the service would be ready.\n\nEvery team needs to prepare the outline for each session. The sessions should be prepared attending to the goals for every session. At this stage, the team prepares a detailed outline for session 1 and a preliminary outline for sessions 2 and 3, which could be later revised and updated according to the results and the experience gathered in previ-ous sessions. See the instructions provided in the next sections to get an idea of the session structure and contents.\n\nPlan the resources:\n- List the resources that you need to run every of the sessions. Decide who will take care of this issue among the members of the core team.\n\nPlan the process:\n- The facilitator will provide details on how to implement the three co-creation sessions with the stakeholders. The ideal scenario is that every team has a facili-tator that helps run the co-creation session. Every team could be located in a different room so that there are no interferences among the teams.\u00a0\n- In the case that \u201creal stakeholders\u201d can\u2019t attend the sessions, then, some participants can roleplay those stakeholders. For that, the team should be large enough to allow for several profiles in the co-creation session. Every actor should prepare its point of view related to the topic. This can be done by observing the behaviour of that profile or getting information from them (e.g., interviews, desk research, etc.).\n- List the major tasks of the co-creation process, set the deadlines and the responsible persons for each deliverable.\n\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0Presentations and conclusions\nEvery team should present the co-creation design to the assigned facilitator to get feed-back. In fact, the facilitator can be part of the co-creation team and thus, she guides and helps the participants along the required tasks of this session. The session ends with a final presentation of every team, with the problem domain identified, the stakeholders and a brief summary of the design of the three sessions.\n\nSESSION 2- Co-creation session 1 - Problem identification\nThe first session of the co-creation process is the most relevant one, since it sets the context for trust among the participants, which is crucial to the contribution of every stakeholder to the co-creation team. The ambience of trust needs to be generated by the core team who needs to set the conditions for collaboration and contribution.\n\nThe outline for this session could be:\n1. Introduction of the core team\n2. Purpose of the project (what service is going to be designed or redesigned).\n3. Goal of the first session\n4. Rules for contribution\n5. Who is in the session (stakeholders invited)\n6. Warm-up and introduction of the stakeholders\n7. Brainstorming of needs, problems, difficulties related to the service according to the perspective of every stakeholders.\n8. Sharing results of the brainstorming\n9. Synthetizing the results of the brainstorming.\n10. Next commitments\n\nBefore conducting the session, decide who in the core team is in charge of introducing every phase of the session.\n\nThe rules for contributing to the session and the remaining sessions of the co-creation process are:\n\n- There are no hierarchies (such as patient-doctor, student-professor).\u00a0\n- All stakeholders have the same relevance and should provide their own point of view.\n- All stakeholders provide a valuable experience or point of view.\n- There are no correct or incorrect answers or opinions.\n- There is no need to edit or correct another\u2019s opinion. All opinions are valuable and will be gathered.\n- The values for the sessions are: humility, respect for others, communication, collaboration, \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid of asking\u201d.\n\nFor step 7, it would be nice to group the different stakeholders in teams and allow them brainstorm the problems and difficulties that they find from their own experience. To prevent some opinions dominate or bias others, brainwriting is a better option than a regular brainstorming.\n\nAs for the \u201cNext commitments\u201d, the core team can provide a metaphor that gives an enhanced meaning to their endeavour (e.g., the team as a boat that navigates to their destiny) and invites all the stakeholders to commit to the next sessions.\n\nAfter the session, the core team synthesizes the results and sends a slidedoc to all the stakeholders with the main insights. The insights should be grouped in different areas. For example, when designing a better service, some clusters of problems could be: a) opening hours, b) communication with the waiters, c) quality and diversity of food, d) food and drink experience, etc.\n\nSESSION 3 - Co-creation session 2 \u2013 Co-Design\nThe session starts by reviewing the results of the previous session and setting the goal for the current session, which is co-designing the service. As follows, there is an outline for the session:\n1. Welcoming the participants.\n2. Wrap up of previous session: presenting the results of the session and the problems identified in several clusters.\n3. Ice breaker activity with participation of every member of the co-creation team.\n4. Brainstorming solutions for each cluster (as before, brainwriting can be a better alternative).\n5. Sharing the solutions\n6. Organising the different solutions in different categories for each cluster\n7. Voting and selection of the best solutions\n8. Final conclusions & next steps\n9. Next commitments (reference to the metaphor \u201cthe boat is sailing with favourable winds\u201d).\n\nAfter the session, the core team summarises the output of the session and sends a document with the main conclusions to the whole co-creation team.\n\nSESSION 4- Co-creation session 3 - Validation\nThe goal of this session is to allow the co-creation team to validate the service design. For that, the core team presents a prototype collecting the main ideas of the service and the co-creation team validates the service through a series of activities.\n\nThe prototype of the service in a number of ways:\n- Design of an application (using a sotware such as Figma, or using drawings in a paper)\n- Service design depicted in different visuals, among them, storyboards showing the customer experience.\n- Roleplay with a drafted scenario.\n- Landing page (see 3.5. Design Validation\u201d \u2013 Advanced)\n\nThe core team has also prepared a series of activities that the remaining co-creation team should run in order to validate the service. Depending on the service design, and the prototype that is built, the team can be challenged to conduct tests to see whether the service is adequate and responds to the identified problems and needs. For example, if the team is designing a new bar service, the participants are challenged to perform tasks:\n- Go to the bar at 7pm and it is closed. How can you know the opening hours? How can you get your drink if it is closed?\n- Look at the menu and choose a veggie menu.\n\nThe team can evaluate the quality of the service by filling in a form or template, so that feedback is gathered systematically.\n\nIt is important to conclude the session and thank the participants for their effort and contribution. The metaphor is used again and every participant of the co-creation team can get a small gift for their contribution to the co-creation process. The gift can be connected to the metaphor or the work done during the sessions.\n\nAfter the session, the core team summarises the insights of the session and sends an executive summary to the co-creation team with the insights of the whole process. It is good that the document contains the next steps that will be taken to develop or further test the service.\n\nSESSION 5 - Insights and conclusions\nIn the final session, all the teams present their projects, by detailing the process followed, the final service and learnings and takeaways from the experience.\u00a0\nThe facilitator asks the participants to reflect on meta-learnings of this experience:\n- What are the benefits of co-creation?\n- What are the differences between co-creation and design thinking?\n- Did you obtain insights and results that wouldn\u2019t have been identified with other methods?\n- What were the most difficult tasks of the process?\n- How did you build trust among the participants?\n- How did the participants contribute to the process?\n- What difficulties did you face?\n- What would you make differently if you did it again?", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "References:\n\nLucero, A., Vaajakallio, K., Dalsgaard, P.

In a nascent entrepreneurship project, the founding group is the first asset available and therefore the development of a good team is a task prior to any other activity.\u00a0\n\nThis section differentiates between group and team. A group is a set of people. A team is a group which is organized to carry out a specific mission. The entrepreneurial team is created, in the first instance, upon the balance of skills, with the awareness that their strength comes from the correct balance between a large number of skills, both general and specialist, that is, linked to the field where the entrepreneurship is circumscribed.\u00a0\n\nIn well-functioning teams, two types of talents coexist:\u00a0\n\n- The individual talent treasured by each of the members\u00a0\n\n- Collective talent, which lies in the task organization system and the forms of relationship between people. This collective talent, also referred to as intellectual capital, expresses the team's potential to achieve its goals.\u00a0\n\nIn the literature, the term good team refers to a high performance team (HPT). These are teams of people who are recognized for their rapport, energy and group creativity. High-performance teams are characterized by the existence of strong relationship ties between their members, which is attributed to characteristics such as:\u00a0\n\n\n- Commitment to the project that is achieved by sharing the expectations and motivations of each member based on a clear structure of incentives.\u00a0\n\n- Competence, which is based on the complementary skills of all the members, which can be explicated by establishing roles and functions according to the knowledge and skills of each member.\u00a0\n\n- Cohesion of the members, which is achieved by sharing the mission and vision of the project within a compatible cultural and values substrate.\u00a0\n\n- Trust, which maintains focus, prevents loss of energy, and is based on the creation, over time, of bonds of trust between people. The team's rules of the game (commonly accepted rules that in the medium term can lead to partner agreements) are the basis of this trust.\u00a0\n\nTaking all this into consideration, the first job to do to build a team is to get to know yourself. For this reason, this module focuses on self-knowledge. The activity presented here is designed to be carried out with a large group of people who want to deepen the technique of team building.\n\n\u00a0Method\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Personal Introduction Cards Play (DinA5 JPEG card) is a way to reflect about us in front of a group of people. It introduces relevant aspects of oneself and in relation to the team: knowing oneself and delving into aspects such as personality and identity. It is a way of presenting the concept of a team as an organized group of people who share a mission and a purpose. Afterwards, the participants are invited to think about what makes a good team and deduce what each one can contribute to the team. Aspects such as affinity of interests and identity as well as complementarity in terms of skills and personality are valued both at the individual and collective level. Thanks to the cards game, the participants create potential groups where these aspects can be questioned and debated. The cards are an essential step to proceed later to the creation of the team with the Team Up Map.\u00a0\n\nFirst, every participant fills in the personal card, by writing down their interests, skills, identity and personality. The game consists of mixing all the DINA5 cards in a deck. Then, groups of cards are created randomly (containing each group between 4 and 6 cards). The groups are visualized on the virtual whiteboard (or manually in a workshop). Then, within each group, the participants are invited to discuss about the team, by debating on the aspects of affinity and complementary, and the effect that these aspects would have in the performance of the team. Additionally, they issue their opinion based on individual and collective talent, roles and functions of every member in a team, as well as aspects such as commitment and cohesion.\u00a0", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "The MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory study provides knowledge around what makes a High Performance Team (HPT).

It can be developed between i) unknown people who want to take on a challenge and create a team or ii) between people with previous relationship ties who share an embryonic entrepreneurial idea. As a result, the method delivers a first team-project fit. This initial fit is perfected iteratively as the entrepreneurial project progresses, thanks to the use of the \"entrepreneurial team canvas\" that is dynamic, flexible and agile to solve.

One way to make all the participants get to know each other is a speed-dating dynamic, with the support of the cards. At the end of this dynamic, everyone gets to know each other and we proceed to the creation of working groups.\u00a0\n\n\nStep 2: Group creation and challenge setting\u00a0\n\nGroups are created (the size depends on the type of dynamic) seeking affinity in terms of expectations and values and complementarity in terms of competencies and balance of functions.\u00a0\n\na.\u00a0\u00a0Fit between participants. A matching process is used to create the groups from the presentations. For example, you start by creating a team of two with a partner with whom you share many aspects, and from there, the number of members is increased two by two, seeking complementarity in skills.\u00a0\n\nb.\u00a0\u00a0Selection of challenges. Once the teams are created, every team chooses a challenge, that is, the problem they seek to solve. Depending on the case, it can be a common challenge for all groups, a distribution of challenges from a list or a freely chosen challenge. In the latter case, the members of the group develop a dynamic to identify and agree on a common challenge.\u00a0\n\n\nStep 3: Definition of the team\u00a0\n\nIn this step, the group uses the team generation tool (Team Up Map) to define a high performance team. The team already has some members and has chosen a challenge on entrepreneurship and innovation. The map is developed together as the first step to start taking on the challenge:\u00a0\n\na.\u00a0\u00a0Definition of the purpose. The purpose explains the main reason for being of the team.

Call for Ideas: Two times a year, Talented Youngsters / High Potential submit a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) with an idea that generates economic, ecological, and social impact for the region (first deadline by the end of the winter term, e.g. January, second deadline by the end of the summer term, e.g. July).\u00a0\n2. Idea Pitch: Two times a year, during the Idea Pitch Day, a max of 4 Talented Youngsters / High Potentials are selected (based on the submitted factsheets) to pitch in front of a panel of experienced entrepreneurs from the region / experts of the respective fields (e.g., 5 to 10 entrepreneurs/experts).\nIdea Pitch Day:\n- Welcome & Introduction of program, participants, entrepreneurs/experts\n- Idea Pitch of a max. of 4 ideas (15 minutes time per pitch)\n- Evaluation of pitches and ideas by entrepreneurs/experts in camera (1 hour), selection of the winning idea and selection of mentor candidates. The entrepreneurs/experts decide, which idea they are most interested in and which idea they would be willing to support and which Talented Youngster they would like to mentor over half a year. It may be that they all want to support and accompany the same idea and only one Talented Youngster. This is a strategic decision (although it might be emotionally driven too) and depends on the field of expertise, on the individual chemistry between mentor and mentee, and on the conviction that the mentor can contribute, but will get something in return too.\n- Mentor Matching: Those mentors, who decide to support a Talented Youngster and his/her idea, stand up and offer their help, giving a short promotional speech why they would like to help and why they are the right choice of a mentor. The Talented Youngster decides by whom he/she would like to be mentored. If the Talented Youngster finds a mentor, the matching is successful and both will proceed to the awarding ceremony. Each Talented Youngster can only decide for one mentor, although several offers may have been made, unless mentors do not decide to cooperate (entrepreneurs may decide to bundle their competences and support an idea as a team). It may be that all four Talented Youngsters get an offer; it may be that none of the candidates gets an offer. The matching should ideally bring together a young start-upper and a successful entrepreneur, but also for example an enthusiastic young intrapreneur with a leader/manger/CEO or a young professional with an expert of the field.\n- Awarding Ceremony: if a matching between Talented Youngster and Experienced Entrepreneur takes place, these two proceed to the awarding ceremony. If possible, the entrepreneur/expert offers also monetary start-up aid to support the idea, but above all, the entrepreneur agrees to act as a role model and mentor for the youngster, sharing feedback, insights and network for a period of six months.\n3. Mentoring: Learning together is better \u2013 The Talented Youngsters document their journey (e.g. in a diary, blog) with the experienced entrepreneur/expert throughout six months. They meet every month at least once (digital or in person). The mentoring process is coordinated and pre-structured by the instructor/facilitator. Documentation (e.g. diary keeping, blog) must be provided for each meeting:\n\nMentoring Process\nMonth Milestones Description Documentation\nMonth 1 1. Familiarization Get to know each other: the entrepreneur introduces the Youngster to his/her spheres of action. The Youngster again explains his/her intentions. Common goals are defined. Photo of the first meeting and outline of common goals in written form.\nMonth 2 2. Polishing idea Idea is presented again and entrepreneur gives critical feedback and suggestions for improvement. Written reflection about feedback by Talented Youngster.\nMonth 3 3. Network Introduction into the network of the entrepreneur, establishing contacts and building up a network. Proof of contacting a min. of 5 relevant stakeholders (e.g. email correspondence, photo, etc.).\nMonth 4 4. Prototyping and Interim Presentation Pilot phase and pre-implementation phase of idea. Documentation of the prototyping phase via Screencast, created jointly by Youngster and entrepreneur.\nMonth 5 5. Mentoring This milestone refers to the lessons learned during the mentoring, in particular inspiration and benefits that the entrepreneur can take away from the mentoring. Of course, also challenges and negative reflections should be shared. Written reflection about mentoring process and mentoring experience.\u00a0\nMonth 6 6. Idea Realization This is the ideal case but not a must. Try to evaluate if the intended goals have been reached or explain why they could have not been reached and how to reach them in the future. Give an outlook for the future (e.g. is the idea worth to be pursued in future? Development opportunities\u2026). Two final reports, one by the Youngster and one by the entrepreneur.\n\nPreparation for Instructors/Facilitators:\n1. Connect with entrepreneurs / experts from the region and try to convince them for the program. This is not a must, but it will be much easier if you have allies and is much more in scope of the program as it renders the program more effective in terms of developing and fostering the competence Learning Through Experience and making a regional impact.\n2. Try to activate your partners and network in the region and let them sign a memorandum of understanding to participate in the program as mentors for six months. These mentors act as enabler, start-up support, idea polishers, role model, inspirers, experts and evaluators. Do not forget to point out the value added for participating in this program as mentors (example below). At the same time, try to convince them to give start up aids and provide monetary support to those ideas/talents that they are especially interested in. Alternatively, you may choose internal candidates from your own organisation to take part in the program.\nBenefits for entrepreneurs/experts:\n- Access to and active shaping of innovative ideas with added value for the region.\n- Setting the course for the regional economy and innovativeness.\n- Network expansion.\n- Exchanging ideas with young motivated people and forming the next generation of entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs in the region/organization.\n- Collecting mentoring experience and considering it for human resource development or customer relationship management.\n- PR & image cultivation.\n3. Try to identify talented youngsters in your area in terms of high potentials. You may have internal processes/programs, which will guide you in doing so. If not you may start an open call for submissions of ideas where everybody can submit ideas (every employee of an organisation / every student at the university) or only a selected pool of people (only employees from the department/working group XY / students belonging to the faculty of social sciences).\n4.

The Talented Youngster decides by whom he/she would like to be mentored. If the Talented Youngster finds a mentor, the matching is successful and both will proceed to the awarding ceremony. Each Talented Youngster can only decide for one mentor, although several offers may have been made, unless mentors do not decide to cooperate (entrepreneurs may decide to bundle their competences and support an idea as a team). It may be that all four Talented Youngsters get an offer; it may be that none of the candidates gets an offer. The matching should ideally bring together a young start-upper and a successful entrepreneur, but also for example an enthusiastic young intrapreneur with a leader/manger/CEO or a young professional with an expert of the field.\n- Awarding Ceremony: if a matching between Talented Youngster and Experienced Entrepreneur takes place, these two proceed to the awarding ceremony. If possible, the entrepreneur/expert offers also monetary start-up aid to support the idea, but above all, the entrepreneur agrees to act as a role model and mentor for the youngster, sharing feedback, insights and network for a period of six months.\n3. Mentoring: Learning together is better \u2013 The Talented Youngsters document their journey (e.g. in a diary, blog) with the experienced entrepreneur/expert throughout six months. They meet every month at least once (digital or in person). The mentoring process is coordinated and pre-structured by the instructor/facilitator. Documentation (e.g. diary keeping, blog) must be provided for each meeting:\n\nMentoring Process\nMonth Milestones Description Documentation\nMonth 1 1. Familiarization Get to know each other: the entrepreneur introduces the Youngster to his/her spheres of action. The Youngster again explains his/her intentions. Common goals are defined. Photo of the first meeting and outline of common goals in written form.\nMonth 2 2. Polishing idea Idea is presented again and entrepreneur gives critical feedback and suggestions for improvement. Written reflection about feedback by Talented Youngster.\nMonth 3 3. Network Introduction into the network of the entrepreneur, establishing contacts and building up a network. Proof of contacting a min. of 5 relevant stakeholders (e.g. email correspondence, photo, etc.).\nMonth 4 4. Prototyping and Interim Presentation Pilot phase and pre-implementation phase of idea. Documentation of the prototyping phase via Screencast, created jointly by Youngster and entrepreneur.\nMonth 5 5. Mentoring This milestone refers to the lessons learned during the mentoring, in particular inspiration and benefits that the entrepreneur can take away from the mentoring. Of course, also challenges and negative reflections should be shared. Written reflection about mentoring process and mentoring experience. \nMonth 6 6. Idea Realization This is the ideal case but not a must. Try to evaluate if the intended goals have been reached or explain why they could have not been reached and how to reach them in the future. Give an outlook for the future (e.g. is the idea worth to be pursued in future? Development opportunities\u2026). Two final reports, one by the Youngster and one by the entrepreneur.\n\nPreparation for Instructors/Facilitators:\n1. Connect with entrepreneurs / experts from the region and try to convince them for the program. This is not a must, but it will be much easier if you have allies and is much more in scope of the program as it renders the program more effective in terms of developing and fostering the competence learning through experience and making a regional impact.\n2. Try to activate your partners and network in the region and let them sign a memorandum of understanding to participate in the program as mentors for six months. These mentors act as enabler, start-up support, idea polishers, role model, inspirers, experts and evaluators. Do not forget to point out the value added for participating in this program as mentors (example below). At the same time, try to convince them to give start up aids and provide monetary support to those ideas/talents that they are especially interested in. Alternatively, you may choose internal candidates from your own organisation to take part in the program.\nBenefits for entrepreneurs/experts:\n- Access to and active shaping of innovative ideas with added value for the region.\n- Setting the course for the regional economy and innovativeness.\n- Network expansion.\n- Exchanging ideas with young motivated people and forming the next generation of entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs in the region/organization.\n- Collecting mentoring experience and considering it for human resource development or customer relationship management.\n- PR & image cultivation.\n3. Try to identify talented youngsters in your area in terms of high potentials. You may have internal processes/programs, which will guide you in doing so. If not you may start an open call for submissions of ideas where everybody can submit ideas (every employee of an organisation / every student at the university) or only a selected pool of people (only employees from the department/working group XY / students belonging to the faculty of social sciences).\n4. Prepare a factsheet (template available \u2013 see resources) that must be filled in in order to submit an idea. We recommend a digital process, e.g. online form.\n5. Prepare a standardized mentoring process.\n", "resources_educators_and_business_trainers": "a) Template Factsheet for idea outline (pdf for download) ##resources/3.7::TYMFactSheet.pdf## \nb) Template for standardized mentoring process and documentation guidelines (pdf for download) ##resources/3.7::TemplateMentoringProcess.pdf##", "resources_for_participants": "a)Template Factsheet for idea outline (pdf for download) ##resources/3.7::TYMFactSheet.pdf## ", "external/additional_material": null, "additional_competences": null, "additional_competences_2": null, "additional_competences_3": null, "additional_competences_4": null, "additional_competences_5": null, "additional_competences_6": null, "additional_competences_7": null, "additional_competences_8": null, "id": 58}]}
